the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place  the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee  which had overall charge of the election   deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted  the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr   only a relative handful of such reports was received   the jury said   considering the widespread interest in the election  the number of voters and the size of this city   the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous   it recommended that fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them   the grand jury commented on a number of other topics  among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments   merger proposed however  the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration   the city purchasing department  the jury said   is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies   it urged that the city  take steps to remedy  this problem  implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury  it urged that the next legislature  provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected   the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes   this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program   the jury said  but the state welfare department  has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county  which receives none of this money  the jurors said they realize  a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties   nevertheless   we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds   the jurors said   failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden  on fulton taxpayers  the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers  guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation  wards protected the jury said it found the court  has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations  of two previous grand juries  the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee   these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms   the jury said  regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport  the jury recommended  that when the new management takes charge jan  the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences   the jury did not elaborate  but it added that  there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable   ask jail deputies on other matters  the jury recommended that     four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and  a doctor  medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail      fulton legislators  work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable  pension plan for city employes  the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department  the fulton tax commissioners office  the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms  grady hospital and the fulton health department  mayor william b hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife  pearl williams hartsfield  in fulton superior

he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr  who became a candidate in the sept  primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection  georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the  governors race  a top official said wednesday  robert snodgrass  state gop chairman  said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience  state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept  in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker  in the blue ridge meeting  the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters  despite the warning  there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate  according to republicans who attended  when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race  it voted no  and there were no dissents  the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race  one of two alternative courses must be taken   five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot  or  the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system  a system which the party opposes in its platform  sam caldwell  state highway department public relations director  resigned tuesday to work for lt

bond money it approved will follow shortly  before adjournment monday afternoon  the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made  gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment  vandiver likely will mention the  million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item  construction bonds meanwhile  it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first  million worth of highway reconstruction bonds  the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act  and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways  a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some  million to  million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work  a revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities  vandiver opened his race for governor in  with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of  million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin  the highway department source told the constitution  however  that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds  schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a  per day increase in expense allowances  pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the  quickie  vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought  while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out  pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through   a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of

opposed in the past  rep mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to  endorse increased federal support for public education  provided that such funds be received and expended  as state funds  barber  who is in his th year as a legislator  said there  are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it  the resolution  passed   but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution  the resolution  which barber tossed into the house hopper friday  will be formally read monday  it says that  in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds   the state board of education should be directed to  give priority  to teacher pay raises  colquitt  after a long  hot controversy  miller county has a new school superintendent  elected  as a policeman put it  in the  coolest election i ever saw in this county   the new school superintendent is harry davis  a veteran agriculture teacher  who defeated felix bush  a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee  davis received  votes in saturdays election  and bush got   ordinary carey williams  armed with a pistol  stood by at the polls to insure order   this was the coolest  calmest election i ever saw   colquitt policeman tom williams said   being at the polls was just like being at church  i didnt smell a drop of liquor  and we didnt have a bit of trouble   the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet  however  it was marked by controversy  anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence  the former county school superintendent  george p callan  shot himself to death march   four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board  during the election campaign  both candidates  davis and bush  reportedly received anonymous telephone calls  ordinary williams said he  too  was subjected to anonymous calls soon after

abandoned property  act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers  daniel personally led the fight for the measure  which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures  in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation  under committee rules  it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week  but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it  daniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce  million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of  million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug   he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since texas was a republic   it permits the state to take over bank accounts  stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more  the bill  which daniel said he drafted personally  would force banks  insurance firms  pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer  the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property  daniel declared  dewey lawrence  a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association  sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers   if you destroy confidence in banks  you do something to the economy   he said   you take out of circulation many millions of dollars   rep charles e hughes of sherman  sponsor of the bill  said a failure to enact it would amount  to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks  insurance and pipeline companies   his contention was denied by several bankers  including scott hudson of sherman  gaynor b jones of houston  j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin  cox argued that the bill is  probably unconstitutional  since  he said  it would impair contracts  he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing  since the bill was introduced only last monday  austin  texas  senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties  the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state  there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house  it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of  or more population  require deaf children between  and  years of age to attend the day schools  permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here  operating budget for the day schools in the five counties

would be  scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county  saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school  dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e  red  berry and joe ratcliff  while details are still to be worked out  ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected   were getting more  pro  letters than  con  on horse race betting   said ratcliff   but i believe if people were better informed on this question  most of them would oppose it also  im willing to stake my political career on it   rep berry  an exgambler from san antonio  got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies  a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report  although the resolution faces hard sledding later  the house passed finally  and sent to the senate  a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities  the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees  passing the three on the calendar  one validated acts of school districts  another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district  the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district  for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted  without dissent  senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district  money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site  two tax revision bills were passed  one  by sen louis crump of san saba  would aid more than  retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized  instead  retailers would sign a certificate of correctness  violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison  plus a  fine  it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league  the other bill  by sen a m aikin jr of paris  would relieve real estate brokers  who pay their own annual licensing fee  from the  annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds  natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain  under a bill by sen frank owen   of el paso  to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas  marshall formby of

under formbys plan  an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor  lieutenant governor  speaker of the house  attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court  austin  texas  state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay  an adverse vote of  to  kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april  ballot  when texas votes on a us senator  rep wesley roberts of seminole  sponsor of the poll idea  said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill  the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb   the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval  by twothirds majorities  before march  to be printed on the april  ballot  roberts said  opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice  all dallas members voted with roberts  except rep bill jones  who was absent  austin  texas  paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday  rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise  a wise county hamlet of  people  when the shouting ended  the bill passed   to   sending it to the senate  where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas  most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse  the bill would increase from  to  the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project  cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas  statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds  and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill  did not sway cottens attack  the bills defenders were mostly smalltown legislators like j w buchanan of dumas  eligio  kika  de la garza of mission  sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs   this is a poor boys bill   said chapman   dallas and fort worth can vote bonds  this would

chester o strickland  state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a  blue ribbon  citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program  the report  culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm  listed  long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load  the report called racial discrimination in employment  one of the most serious causes of family breakdown  desertion  and adc dependency    must solve problem  the monthly cost of adc to more than  recipients in the county is  million dollars  said c virgil martin  president of carson pirie scott  co  committee chairman   we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence   martin said  the volume of adc cases will decrease  martin reported  when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems  relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color  these  he said  are  two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc   calls for extension other recommendations made by the committee are  extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives  including both parents  as a means of preserving family unity  research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy  several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest  judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday  the disclosure by charles bellows  chief defense counsel  startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial  bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client  alan clements    a separate trial  bellows made the request while the allwoman jury was out of the courtroom  fears prejudicial aspects  the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client   bellows told the court   some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property  it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others   judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired   you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this     yes  your honor   replied bellows   what this amounts to  if true  is that there will be a freeforall fight in this case  there is a conflict among the defendants   washington  july   president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio  the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone  shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port  mass  a white house spokesman said the address text still had  quite a way to go  toward completion  decisions are made asked to elaborate  pierre salinger  white house press secretary  replied   i would say its got to go thru several more drafts   salinger said the work president kennedy  advisers  and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording  rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city  the last  cases in the investigation of the nov  election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns  who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence  by unfair and fundamentally illegal means   karns said that the cases involved a matter  of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence  of the  persons  he said evidence was obtained  in violation of the legal rights of citizens   karns ruling pertained to eight of the  cases  in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been  unable to make a case   contempt proceedings originally had been brought against  persons in  precincts by morris j wexler  special prosecutor  issue jury subpoenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about  persons involved in the election investigation  questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building  but did not take them before the grand jury  mayer goldberg  attorney for election judges in the th precinct of the d ward  argued this procedure constituted intimidation  wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning  karns said it was a  wrongful act  for wexler to take statements  privately and outside of the grand jury room   he said this constituted a  very serious misuse  of the criminal court processes   actually  the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county  altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court   said karns  who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court  faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving  persons  wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with  complementary  miscount of the vote  in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another  the cases involved judges in the d  th  and d precincts of the st ward  the st and th precincts of the th ward  the th precinct of the th ward  and the th precinct of the d ward  the case of the judges in the th precinct of the d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns  two other cases also were under advisement  claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the d ward case  karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed  he would dismiss them  washington  feb   president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on  million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of  million americans over  who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs  the president  in a special message to congress  tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships  build  new medical and  new dental schools  and expand child health care and general medical research  the aged care plan  similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator  a fight on capitol hill  it was defeated in congress last year  cost up to  a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as  a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes  the social security payroll tax is now  per cent   per cent on each worker and employer  on the first  of pay per year  the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to  a year and the payroll tax to  per cent   per cent each  similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system  the payroll tax would actually rise to  per cent starting jan     if the plan is approved  because the levy is already scheduled to go up by  per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs  outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to  billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run  billion or more in the first year    both figures would go higher in later years  other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of  million to  billion dollars over the next  years  these would be paid for out of general  not payroll  taxes  nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over  who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems   full payment of hospital bills for stays up to  days for each illness  except that the patient would pay  a day of the cost for the first nine days   full payment of nursing home bills for up to  days following discharge from a hospital  a patient could receive up to  days paidfor nursing home care under a  unit formula  allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit   hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of  a patient   community visiting nurse services at home for up to  days an illness  the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged  calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to  meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense  but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings  or those of their children  caused by an extended hospital stay    this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs   he said   and with sufficient  deductible  requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals   this is not a program of socialized medicine  it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed  every person will choose his own doctor and hospital   wouldnt pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills  they would still be paid by the patient  apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships  and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools  the president said the nations  medical and  dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care  moreover  he said  many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs  contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to  a year for onefourth of the first year students  the schools could use the money to pay year scholarships  based on need  of up to  a year per student  in addition  the government would pay a   cost of education  grant to the schools for each  in scholarship grants  officials estimated the combined programs would cost  million dollars the first year and would go up to  millions by   the president recommended federal  matching grants  totaling  million dollars in  years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones  more for nursing homes in the area of  community health services   the president called for doubling the present  million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction  he asked for another  million dollar  initial  appropriation for  stimulatory grants  to states to improve nursing homes  he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals  in the child health field  the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau  he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute  asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation  he did not say by how much  for medical research he asked a  million dollar a year increase  from  to  millions  in matching grants for building research facilities  the president said he will also propose increasing  by an unspecified amount  the  million dollars in the  budget for direct government research in medicine  the president said his proposals combine the  indispensable elements in a sound health program  people  knowledge  services  facilities  and the means to pay for them   reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines  legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan  those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message  senate republican leader dirksen  ill  and house republican leader charles halleck  ind  said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance  halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first  house speaker sam rayburn  d  tex  called the kennedy program  a mighty fine thing   but made no prediction on its fate in the house  washington  feb   acting hastily under white house pressure  the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief  only  senators were on the floor and there was no record vote  a number of scattered  ayes  and  noes  was heard  customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency  in the last eight years  all presidential appointments  including those of cabinet rank  have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a  hour delay after they are reported to the floor  enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse  d  ore  in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in  and president kennedys in   oslo the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer  franker  and wider discussions  animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings  this has been a working session of an organization that  by its very nature  can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes  in oslo  the ministers have met in a climate of candor  and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems  this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never  or not for a long time  had such problems  the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa  exacerbated by the difficulties  changes  and tragedies facing them  and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about  has been conspicuous by its absence  explosion avoided in the case of portugal  which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh  there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension  the general  remarkably courteous  explanation has left basic positions unchanged  but there has been no explosion in the council  there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes  since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance  canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive  even norway  despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance  is today closer to the nato line  on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for  one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as  inconclusive   but he hastened to add that  if united states policies were not always clear  despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west  this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy  exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair  with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited  the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days  despite mr rusks personal popularity  that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind  more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots  the secretary of state himself  in his first speech  gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months  but where the core of nato is concerned  the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance   cornerstone  of its foreign policy  but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters  the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin  an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole  conflict surveyed the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction  wherever it take place around the globe  is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies  and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection  the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions  more  deeper  and more timely political consultation within the alliance  the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development  when ratified  as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries  and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent  this increase in the  threshold   as the conventional forces strengthening is called  will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come  each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down  but never completely fulfilled  washington the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time  there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos  the united states  state department officials explain  now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam  they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this  the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated  but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility  policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos  rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference  this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make  it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration  its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas  but with the months moving on  and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world  the question arises  how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression   former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union  he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory  gop restrained it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it  they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans  if they had been in power  would have made  amateurish and monumental blunders  in cuba  one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score  his reply  he said  was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now  but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first  the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton  r  of kentucky  chairman of the republican national committee  that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination  kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by  harvard  boston university  brandeis  and massachusetts institute of technology educators  detente urged this group pleads with the administration to  give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups   it recommends that the united states  seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations   and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds   mr nixon  for his part  would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation  but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated  until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos  almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected  generally  the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors  aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels  a high official source disclosed  that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration  strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements  policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed  but thus far there has been no response in kind  foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations  in laos  the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture  again and again it asked the communists to  freeze  the military situation in laos  but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate  and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup  administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a  great service  and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization  seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos  but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos   some seato nations disagreed  however   there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally  unlike its more determined neighbors  thailand and south viet nam  the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos  the prowestern government  which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma  neutralist  government  never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army  there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt  if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma  whom it felt was too trusting of communists  it gradually had to relinquish them  one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright  d  of arkansas  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  he declared on march  that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by  encouraging the removal  of prince souvanna  washington the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states  the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the  vitality of the nation   in an important assertion of national leadership in this field  he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime  to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems  the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend  offenses multiply the president has also called upon the attorney general  the secretary of health  education and welfare  and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts  in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem  simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett  a special assistant to the attorney general  as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime  his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since   each year showing an increase in offenders  among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in   about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under  years of age  east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director  raymond h hawksley  the present city cd head  believes  mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time  east providence now has no civil defense program  mr hawksley  the states general treasurer  has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years  he is not interested in being named a fulltime director  noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program  mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director  he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about  a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs  mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job  one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin  he said  along with a director  the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized  mr hawksley said  one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director  he said  is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program  matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios  sirens and rescue trucks  he said  mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks  similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station  he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area  speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city  mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack  the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point  he said  and a drivein theater in seekonk would be another  riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point  mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack  such vital information  he said  has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know  if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director  mr hawksley said  then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally  one of the first things he would do  he said  would be to organize classes in first aid  other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government  rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind  governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly  the governors move into the socalled  blue law  controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant  deputy city clerk of central falls  a copy was released to the press  mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july  and sent to the state house by miss grant  the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature  while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review  mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get  the benefit of his views   he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation  the governor said   i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings   mr notte said   to obtain the views of the general public and religious  labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws   the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time  with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales   the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws  should there be evidence they are shirking  he has said  the state police will step into the situation  there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws  the statutes  similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times  severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath  the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday  the only day they  have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday   the councils resolution said  the small shops  must be retained  for they provide essential service to the community   according to the resolution  which added that they  also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors   it declares that sunday sales licenses provide  great revenue  to the local government  the council advised the governor that  large supermarkets  factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business  on sunday  they  operate on a volume basis   it was contended   and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community   liberals and conservatives in both parties  democratic and republican  should divorce themselves and form two independent parties  george h reama  nationally known labormanagement expert  said here yesterday  mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the  welfare  type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system  he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day  he said he was  confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in    that  he added  was when he was  a very young man  a machinist and toolmaker by trade   that was before i studied law  some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party  the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track  he steered me to the right track  the free enterprise track   he said that when he was a socialist in   the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources  he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory  most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties  mr reama  who retired as vice president of the american screw co in  said   both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product  but neither told us how to achieve it   he said he favors wage increases for workers   but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze   and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices  he added  indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his  philosophy  mr reama said   a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own   mr reama  far from really being retired  is engaged in industrial relations counseling  a petition bearing the signatures of more than  johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town  william a martinelli  chairman of the citizens group of johnston  transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr  the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within  days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post  mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within  days  he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within  days after the board of canvassers completes its work  a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier  town solicitor  over the exact manner in which the vote is handled  mr martinelli has  in recent weeks  been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote  while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead  mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures  he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible  mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july  to plan further strategy in the charter movement  he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present  but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes   after inspiring this  i think we should certainly follow through on it   he declared   it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement   he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than  members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission   our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement   he indicated   and to tell them what this will mean for the town   he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september  some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday  with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter  increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks  it was indicated  misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed  false pretenses   several signers affixed their names  it was learned  after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system  action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at mondays special north providence town council meeting  council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance  at the last session of the general assembly  the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective  nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation  at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition  local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense  plainfield  james p mitchell and sen walter h jones rbergen  last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes  democratic gubernatorial candidate  that the gop is  campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism   mitchell was for using it  jones against  and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before  persons at the park hotel  the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club  it was greeted with a chorus of boos by  women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs  hughes said monday   it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism  but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired  now hes gone  the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state   sunday he had added   we can love eisenhower the man  even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership   mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign   how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this    he asked  the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican  and proud to have absorbed his philosophy  while working in his adminstration  mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue  regrets attack jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president   he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign   he said   because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into rearguing an old national campaign   the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark  dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary  he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign  state aid to schools  the continuance of railroad passenger service  the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority  and making new jersey attractive to new industry  decries joblessness mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate  must share the blame for this   noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant  he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform   but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time   mitchell said  jones  unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions  saved his barbs for mitchell  he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises   he calls for help while saying he is against centralization  but you cant have it both ways   jones said  the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities  real estate or motor vehicles  he said   and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue   defends ike earlier  mitchell said in a statement   i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes  his reference to  discredited carcass  or  tattered remains  of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history  to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states  and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations   i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste   such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature  it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit   sees jones ahead sen charles w sandman  rcape may  said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination  sandman  state campaign chairman for jones  was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel  newark  of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones  sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years  sandman said   the announcement that sen clifford case aj  has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway  it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems   we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington  that failed   we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year  that  too  will fail   sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of  woodland ave  westfield  as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee  mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman  county supervisor weldon r sheets  who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination  today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them  the proposal  sheets said  represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a  lip service word   sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines  enabling counties to repay the loan over a year period without interest or charge  sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january    although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful  he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines  the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange  for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county  was supported today by edward w roos  west orange public safety commissioner  sheeran  a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organizations candidate  freeholder william macdonald  for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy  now a member of the state board of tax appeals   my experience as public safety commissioner   roos said   has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience  and preferably one who is a lawyer  jim sheeran fits that description   trenton  william j seidel  state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development  has retired after  years of service  a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state  seidel joined the department in  as a division fire warden after graduation in  from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies  in october   he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section  under his supervision  the state firefighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting  he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station  he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens  he is credited with setting up an annual cooperative fire prevention program in cooperation with the red cross and state department of education  boonton  richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge  to carry the issues to every corner of the state   he promised nearly  democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn   when i come back here after the november election youll think   youre my man  youre the kind of governor were glad we elected    he said   we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just  and not what is expedient at the time   attacks republicans in his only attack on the republicans  hughes said   the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary  but well have a liberal  well planned  forward looking  honest platform  well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson   well take the truth to the people  and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november   he said   you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration  but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead   he urged new jersey to  become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy   he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states  and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry   we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean   the former superior court judge said   to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early s   calling the democrats the  party that lives  breathes and thinks for the good of the people   hughes asked   a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november   hughes supported gov meyners  green acres  plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development  he said legislation for a  million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday  conservation plan the plan will provide  million for purchase of open land by the state  the other  million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis  hughes said   this is not a plan to conquer space  but to conserve it   pointing out the state population has increased  each year since   he said  morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas  there will be no land left to preserve   hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved  he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans   after the primary   he promised   ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong  dynamic administration  im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee   trenton  fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring  voluntarily  this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues  the outgoing members  whose fouryear terms will expire a week after the april  primary election  received carved wooden elephants  complete with ivory tusks  to remember the state committee by  there may be other  state committee retirements come april   but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters  a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank  who is stepping down after  years on the committee  she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early s following adoption of the womens suffrage amendment  she served one fouryear term on the national committee  resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates  at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable  some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years  the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders  some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party  opposition reported some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept  democratic primary  these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city  their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor  in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate  mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley  the bronx democratic leader  and with joseph t sharkey  the brooklyn democratic leader  mayor visits buckley as usual  he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio  the manhattan leader  he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party  last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation  apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organizations acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle  in talks with mr buckley last week in washington  the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa  who lives in the bronx  from this years ticket  but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor  screvane and beame hailed the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane  who lives in queens  to replace abe stark  the incumbent  as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame  who lives in brooklyn  to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller  the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx  after his speech  reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions  published in yesterdays new york times  the mayor said   it didnt come from me  but as i have said before  if i announce my candidacy  i will have something definite to say about running mates   boston  june   a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts  there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics  the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are  all the same    its  see joe  see jim    he says   the hand is out   a political scientist writes of the growth of  alienated voters   who  believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt  selfish and beyond popular control  these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy  the object of which is to plunder them   corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel   the last hurrah   but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject  a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year  graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations  and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state  a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery  or worse  is the norm in massachusetts public life  day after day some new episode is reported  the state public works department is accused of having spent  to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property  an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate  washington  june   congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers  in the senate  several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition  in the house  the southernrepublican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administrations housing bill  while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aidtoeducation bill  the housing bill is now in the house rules committee  it is expected to be reported out tuesday  but this is a little uncertain  the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble  democrat of arkansas  who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor  mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday  leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans  the democratic leadership  however  hopes to pass it sometime this week  the  measure  which was passed last monday by the senate  provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families  it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories  the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee  where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy  they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts  three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of   this would provide for longterm federal loans for construction of parochial and other privateschool facilities for teaching science  languages and mathematics  mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee  about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will

several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods  means and goals  there are a number of ways this could happen  the churchmen pointed out  and here is an example  last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled  when he protested  the hotel owner said   why do you worry   the u s government is paying for it  the u s government pays for all its overseas workers   missionary explains  i dont work for the government   the american said   im a missionary   the hotel owner shrugged   same thing   he said  and then  some churchmen remarked  there is a more classical churchstate problem  can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state   r sargent shriver jr  director of the corps  is certain that they can  no religious group  he declared in an interview  will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes  moscow  june

this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations  one effect of the proposal  which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength  as in the past  would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india  india is the most populous united

dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oathtaking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route  pennsylvania avenue  named for one of the original  states  perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint  but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it  many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the united

where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue  begins a series of great federal buildings  some a block long and all about sevenstories high  great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue  now about  years old  in the early spring of  a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch  women parade  they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote  in the

observing the political scene a long time  no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the states immediate political future  this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants  gov ross barnett  barnett  who came into office with no previous experience in public administration  has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well  consequently  it is uncertain after nearly  months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year  could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during  and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far  the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office  there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session  it will really throw his administration into a scramble  certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful  honeymoon  he had in the  legislative session  if barnett doesnt call a special session in   it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session  the odds favor a special session  more than likely early in the year  districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session  whether for the companionship or the  per diem is not certain  and if they start agitating  barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure  the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat  with eyes focused on the third congressional district  the historic delta district  and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go  the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature  mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during   with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house  split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents  the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck  and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together  future clouded barnett  as the titular head of the democratic party  apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary  with a democratic administration  party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election  now  the picture is clouded  and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis  who remained loyal to the ticket  are uncertain of their status  reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen  baton rouge  la  the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in   with the governors theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses  the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue  but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue  that of finances in state government  the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress  in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from  per cent to  per cent  the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy  since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program  but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation  legislators weary indeed  the administrations curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat  the administration could not say why  million was needed for a grantinaid program  the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote  the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes  davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy  if it fails to pass  he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration  he could terminate special sessions of the legislature  actually  davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway  many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration  this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly  they would like to convey the notion something is being done  even though it is something they know to be ineffectual  underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition  he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle  then he could tell them to go home  while the administration continued to wage the battle with the  million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period  it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that  million  since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one  but if the administration should find it does not need the  million for a grantinaid program  a not unlikely conclusion  it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes  this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration  the shortage of cash  it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year  if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill  or any other tax bill  it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma  since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session  the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues  constant problem in either case  it could call a special session of the legislature later in  to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser  the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor  it is one that most try to avoid  as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem  but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off  it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature  this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature  so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year  a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize  any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves  the new year might see some housecleaning  either genuine or token  depending upon developments  to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms  city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside track  with the city  estimates of the citys loss in the  job have ranged as high as   shortcuts unnoticed hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the  legitimate  bids of competing contractors  the hughes concern then took  shortcuts  on the project but got paid anyway  hemphill said  the controllers

  i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated   berger said  the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track  the contract called for overhauling of  joints  the city paid for work on   of which no more than  were repaired  hemphill charged  wide range in bids hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of  for each joint  the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge  mass  which listed the same officers as hughes  was  per joint  but  hemphill added  bids from other contractors ranged from  to  per joint  bergers decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference  wagner said the city paid only  to the hughes company   we wont know the full amount until we get a full report   wagner said   we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond   berger said  wagner replied   cant you just see the headline   city hooked for       know enough to sue  berger insisted that  we know enough to sue for the full amount   douglas m pratt  president of the ptc  who attended the meeting  said the transit

of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night  martin  who has been in office in washington  d c  for  months spoke at the councils annual meeting at the multnomah hotel  he told some  persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways  following their own paths   we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which  if not identical  is congenial with ours   he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty  patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice  he said  was the biggest detriment to the soviet union  he cited east germany where after  years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in  and added   so long as people rebel  we must not give up   martin called for patience on the part of americans   the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build   he said  by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare  he said  individual help best  we have no reason to fear failure  but we must be extraordinarily patient   the assistant secretary said  economically  martin said  the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves  private business is more effective than government aid  he explained  because individuals are able to work with the people themselves  the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country  at what he termed a  social cost   martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country  the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portlands civil defense more plans for the citys schools in event of attack  but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go  and whose advice it should follow  the board members  after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar   sw maplecrest dr  said they thought they had already been cooperating  chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem  in case of atomic attack  but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go  dr melvin w barnes  superintendent  said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership  perhaps on the national level  to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would  be more fruitful   and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district   los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster   he said   nobody really expects to evacuate  i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following  mrs molvar  who kept reiterating her request that they  please take a stand   said   we must have faith in somebody  on the local level  and it wouldnt be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children   dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans  even for a high school where there were lots of cars  might not be realistic and would not work   mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowes program  the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting  it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done  is going to be done and what it thought should be done  salem  ap   the statewide meeting of war mothers tuesday in salem will hear a greeting from gov mark hatfield

bill kunkel  bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before  paying customers in miami stadium  the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth  hartman  purchased by the as from the milwaukee braves last fall  allowed no hits in his scoreless threeinning appearance  and merited the triumph  keegan  a footinch pounder  gave up the orioles last two safeties over the final three frames  escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally  robinson doubles again in the ninth  robinson led off with his second double of the night  a blast off the fence  feet deep into left  whitey herzog  performing in right as the orioles fielded

victory to the chicago white sox today  austin  texas  a texas halfback who doesnt even know the teams plays  eldon moritz  ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games  time stands still every time moritz  a yearold army signal corps veteran  goes into the field  although he never gets to play while the clock is running  he gets a big kick  several every saturday  in fact  out of football  moritz doesnt even have a nose guard or hip pads but hes one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl  thats because he already has kicked  extra points in  tries  he ran his string of successful conversions this season to  straight before one went astray last saturday night in the  slaughter of washington state  moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback  the position at which he lettered on the  team  but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and youll get the quick response   placekicker   a pound  foot inch senior from stamford  moritz practices nothing but placekicking  last year  when he worked out at halfback all season  he didnt get into a single game   this year  coach royal told me if id work on my placekicking he thought he could use me   said moritz   so i started practicing on it in spring training  moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right  kicking  leg and  as a result  several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough  moritz said monday his leg feels fine and  as a result  he hopes to start practicing field goals this week  he kicked several while playing at stamford high school  including one that beat anson    in a  district game   i kicked about  extra points in  tries during three years in high school   he said   and made  in a row at one time  i never did miss one in a playoff game  i kicked about  in the five playoff games my last two years   moritz came to texas in  but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury  he missed the  season because of an operation on the ailing knee  then played  minutes in   his statistical record that year  when texas won only one game and lost nine  was far from impressive  he carried the ball three times for a net gain of  yards  punted once for  yards and caught one pass for  yards  he went into the army in march    and returned two years later  but he was scholastically ineligible in  and merely present last season  place kicking is largely a matter of timing  moritz declared   once you get the feel of it  theres not much to it  ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel  practice helps you to get your timing down   its kind of like golf  if you dont swing a club very often  your timing gets off   moritz  however  kicks only about  or  extra points during each practice session   if you kick too much  your leg gets kinda dead   he explained  footnotes  in their first three games  the longhorns have had the ball  times and scored  times  or  per cent   their total passing yardage in three games   on  completions in  attempts  is only  yards short of their total passing yardage in   when they made  on  completions in  tries  tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season  when he netted  yards on  carries   he now has  yards in  tries during three games  saxton has made only one secondhalf appearance this season and that was in the washington state game  for four plays  he returned the kickoff  yards  gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench  wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists hell be ready for oklahoma  last week  when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conferences top four in rushing  he said   that wont last long   it didnt   monday  he had four longhorns in the top four  a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday  but attention quickly turned from saturdays victory to next weeks problem  rice university  the mustangs dont play this week   were just real happy for the players   coach bill meek said of the  victory over the air force academy   i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on  it was the first time weve been ahead this season  when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal    assistant coach john cudmore described victory as  a good feeling  i think  on the part of the coaches and the players  we needed it and we got it   meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon  both turned in top jobs for the second straight game   nelson played magnificent football   meek praised   he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times  and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown  he broke that boy  air force fullback nick arshinkoff  in two and knocked him loose from the football   gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages  one was on a fourthdown screen pass from the mustang  after an incomplete pass into gannons territory   as soon as it started to form  gannon spotted it   meek said   he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy  halfback terry isaacson  had time to turn around  he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss   the air forces  and the games  final play  was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own  and returned  yards   he just lay back there and waited for it   meek said   he almost brought it back all the way   except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice  meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice   kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game   meek said   hell be out of action all this week  he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game  there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee   rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland   hes looking a lot better  and hes able to run   meek explained   well let him do a lot of running this week  but i dont know if hell be able to play   the game players saw the air force film monday  ran for  minutes  then went in  while the reserves scrimmaged for  minutes   well work hard tuesday  wednesday and thursday   meek said   and probably will have a good scrimmage friday  well work out about an hour on saturday  then well work monday and tuesday of next week  then taper off   smu will

raesz  who broke a hand in the owls game with lsu  was back working out with rice monday  and john nichols  sophomore guard  moved back into action after a weeks idleness with an ankle injury  the texas aggies got a day off monday  a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night  but myers announced that halfback george hargett  shaken up in the tech game  would not play against trinity saturday  halfback bud priddy  slowed for almost a month by a slowlymending sprained ankle  joined tcus workout monday  the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts  a  triumph over the denver broncos  but their visit will be a short one  the texans have two more road games  at buffalo and houston  before they play for the home folks again  and it looks as if coach hank strams men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in preseason reckonings  buffalo coach buster ramsey  who has become one of the games greatest collectors of quarterbacks  apparently now has found a productive pair in two exnational football leaguers  m c reynolds and warren rabb  rabb  the former louisiana state field general  came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a  upset victory over the houston oilers  defending league champions   just our luck    exclaimed stram   buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way   ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself  for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver  and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star  jack spikes  though he did the teams placekicking while nursing a knee injury   our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well   said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game   in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job   the texans won the game through ball control  with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only  passes   we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack   explained stram   they can be going along  doing little damage  then bang  bang  they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble   the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans  but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off  the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes  the flashy halfback  he was called upon  times  more than all of the other ballcarriers combined  and delivered  yards  the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denvers al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson  the speedy halfback  hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas  a quick touchdown resulted   that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away   said stram  quipping   i think ill put that play in the book   the early southwest conference football leaders  texas  arkansas and texas a  m  made a big dent in the statistics last week  texas yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a game total offense of  yards   rushing and  passing  a new swc high  arkansas combined  yards rushing with  yards passing  on  completions in  tosses  and a tough defense to whip tcu  and a  m  with a point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since   completing  of  passes for  yards  the aggies had a total offense of  yards  texas leads in pergame rushing averages   yards  and passing   to baylors    but idle baylor has the best defensive record   yards per game to texas    a  m has the best defense against passes   yards per game  not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use  the major leagues have ordered

 the husky   pound lefthander  was in command all the way before an onthescene audience of only  and countless of television viewers in the denver area  it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight  they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack  nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning  he has given only the one pass in his  innings  an unusual characteristic for a southpaw  the bears took the lead in the first inning  as they did in sundays opener  and never

alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left  jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don werts smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout  the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner  paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzers glove  nischwitz was working on a hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth  chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner  cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines infield roller accounted for the tallies  the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusiks double and outfield flies by porter and wert  gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth  despite the degree weather the game was clicked off in   thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play  chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusiks grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base  bingles and bobbles  cliff cook accounted for three of the tribes eight hits  it was the seasons first night game

night he was through playing baseball   ive had it   he told a newsman   i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any th man on the ball club   this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout  jensen got only six hits in  atbats for a batting average in the first  games  he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday  without an official word to anybody  and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno  nev  where his wife  former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen  awaited  she said  when she learned jackie was heading home   im just speculating  but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances   the union pacific railroad streamliner  city of san francisco  stopped in ogden  utah  for a few minutes  sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him  the conductor said to ritchie   i dont think you want to talk to him  youll probably get a ball bat on the head  hes mad at the world   but jackie had gone into the station  ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand   i told him who i was and he was quite cold  but he warmed up after a while  i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a doublecrosser and said anything he  liston  got was through a keyhole  he said he had never talked to liston   liston is bill liston  baseball writer for the boston traveler  who quoted jensen as saying   i cant hit anymore  i cant run  i cant throw  suddenly my reflexes are gone  just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging  and so it was over the weekend what with yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying homer spree sunday  both  of course  were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime  of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahns hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts  it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the scoreyear milestone  and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked   wish i was   and a topgrade big leaguer  the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days  but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history  yes  with bob grove  carl hubbell  herb pennock  art nehf  vernon gomez  et al  spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow  a ball players ball player  as they say in the trade  i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct     before a new record crowd for the period of    spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions   remarked enos slaughter  another allout guy  who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse  the spectacular mays  who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may   joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings  incidentally  only two did it before a home audience  bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field  ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies  the braves joe adcock  lou gehrig of the yankees  pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito  then with cleveland  made their history on the road  willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle  this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion  depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee  the record books  however  would favor the giants ace  in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as  home runs and stole as many as  bases  once the figure was   willies lifetime batting average of is  points beyond mickeys  the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukees park  it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump  the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs  thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home  this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball  minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the games top rulers  the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the  living room athletic club  when games were cut off  actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy  this year  i am told  the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here  there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise  it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good  especially at the minor league level  you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy  this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game  cincinnati  ohio  ap   the powerful new york yankees won their th world series in a game romp over outclassed cincinnati  crushing the reds in a humiliating  barrage monday in the loosely played finale  with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries  the american league champs still mounted a hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers  the most ever used by one team in a series game  johnny blanchard  mantles replacement  slammed a run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a run first inning  hector lopez  subbing for berra  smashed a run homer off bill henry during another run explosion in the fourth  the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors  the crowd of  had only two chances to applaud  in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center  about  feet away  with two men on  momentarily the reds were back in the ball game  trailing only   but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out  in the fifth  wally post slashed a run homer off bud daley  but by that time the score was  and it really didnt matter  the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager  only bucky harris  the  boymanager  of washington in   and eddie dyer of the st louis cardinals in  had accomplished the feat  philadelphia  jan   nick skorich  the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles  was elevated today to head coach  skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between  and  a year  he succeeds buck shaw  who retired at the end of last season  the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff  jerry williams and charlie gauer  williams is a defensive coach  gauer works with the ends  choice was expected the selection had been expected  skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings  the newest national football league entry  van brocklin  the quarterback who led the eagles to the title  was signed by the vikings last wednesday  philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player  with skorich at the helm  the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running  rather than passing  in the past the club depended largely on van brocklins aerials  skorich  however  is a strong advocate of a balanced attack  split between running and passing  coach played  years skorich  who is  years old  played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers  an injury forced skorich to quit after the  season  he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in   he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy  n y  he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach  four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers  the eagles signed him for shaws staff in   skorich began his new job auspiciously today  at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth  the eagles were honored for winning the championship  shaw and skorich headed a group of players  coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football

illness  the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington  democrat of missouri  golfs golden boy arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months  he won the masters  the united states open and a record  in prize money  he was heralded as  sportsman of the year  by sports illustrated  and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the  professional athlete of the year   a distinction that earned for him the  diamondstudded hickok belt  but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot  a couple of weeks ago  he scored a monstrous  on a par hole  it made him human  and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair  if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege  there was hope left for all  it was neither a spirit of selfsacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold  he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all  the worlds best golfer  shooting below par  came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher  he boomed a yard drive  then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance  no margin for error on the narrow fairway of a yard hole  arnold whipped into his second shot  the ball went off in a majestic arc  an outofbounds slice  he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds  he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side   it is possible that i overcorrected   he said ruefully  each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes  so he wound up with a dozen   it was a nice round figure  that    he said as he headed for the clubhouse  not too much perturbed  from the standpoint of the army of duffers  however  this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an  in the texas open  the idol of the hackers  of course  is ray ainsley  who achieved a  in the united states open  their secondary hero is another pro  willie chisholm  who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully  willies partner was long jim barnes  who tried to keep count  stickler for rules  how many is that  jim    asked willie at one stage of his excavation project   thirteen   said long jim   nae  man   said willie   ye must be countin the echoes   he had a   palmers dozen were honestly earned  nor were there any rules to save him  if there had been  he would have found a loophole  because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book  this knowledge has come in handy  too  his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway  the ball floated downstream  a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy  who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie  arnold sent for joe dey  the executive secretary of the golf association  joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream   i knew it all along   confessed arnold with a grin   but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there   for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity  palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings  yet he remains the fiercest of competitors  hell even bull headon into the rules when he is sure hes right  thats how he first won the masters in   it happened on the twelfth hole  a yarder  arnolds iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green  an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains  thereby bringing local rules into force  ruling from on high  i can remove the ball  cant i    asked palmer of an official   no   said the official   you must play it where it lies    youre wrong   said arnold  a man who knows the rules   ill do as you say  but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling   he scored a  for the embedded ball  a  with the provisional one  the golfing fathers ruled in his favor  so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke  until a few weeks ago  however  arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers  but after that  at los angeles he became one of the boys  a bigger hero than he ever had been before  a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the  schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today  other items on the agenda during the meetings  which are expected to continue through saturday  concern television  rules changes  professional footballs hall of fame  players benefits and constitutional amendments  the owners would like each club in the fourteenteam league to play a homeandhome series with teams in its division  plus two games against teams in the other division  however  this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks  pete rozelle  the league commissioner  pointed out   well have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other   nine of the leagues teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an earlyseason conflict in dates  if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies  they wont be misled by the pirates slower start this season   pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat   mauch said here the other day   the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year  they have the same men  no age problem  no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season  along with bobby shantz   tonight at  oclock the cardinals  who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in   breaking even with them  will get their first  shot at baseballs world champions  the pirates have a  record this year and the redbirds are   change in pitchers  solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher  from bob gibson to ernie broglio  for several reasons   broglios  wonlost record and  earnedrun mark against pittsburgh a year ago    the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible    the redbirds disheartening  collapse against the phillies sunday  manager hemus  eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand  moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment  after thursdays open date  solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night  harvey haddix  set back by the flu this season  will start against his former cardinal mates  who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonights game at busch stadium  boyer is suffering from a stiff neck  haddix has a  record against the redbirds  despite only a  mark in   pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadnt decided between mizell and vern law for wednesdays game  mizell has won both of his starts  nieman kept in lineup  after a lengthy workout yesterday  an open date  hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup  that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record fivehome run day against the giants   i have to stay with nieman for a while   hemus said   bill white  sore ankles  should be ready  with a lefthander going for pittsburgh  i may use don taussig in center    lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about  minutes  and he looked good   hemus said   he should be getting back in the groove before long  our pitching is much better than it has shown   the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice  but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday  six bucks over  until the bucs bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend  the champions had eight men hitting over  despite the recession  pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages  smoky burgess  gino cimoli  bill virdon  bob clemente and dick groat  each  dick stuart  don hoak and bob skinner  bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet  perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend  who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs  friend is off to a great start with a  record but isnt likely to see action here this week   were getting friend some runs for a change  and he has been pitching good   murtaugh said   virdon has been blasting the ball  no plunkers for him   six bucs over  the pirates jumped off to an  start by may  last year  when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season  on last may   the cardinals stood at   ending a twoseason falloff on that milestone  in   the birds were  on may   a year later they were   since   the st louis club has been below on may  just four times  the  team was off to a soso  beginning  then fell as low as  on may  before finishing with  victories  the  cards were  on may  but ended with  triumphs  the clubs top since   then last season the birds tumbled as low as  on may  before recovering to make a race of it and total  victories  since   the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the  dodger team  those dodgers won their first  games and owned a  mark and a ninegame lead by may   the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new yorks  giants  who dropped  of their first   they honored the battling billikens last night  speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who  in the words of coach john benington   had more confidence in themselves than i did   the most valuable player award was split three ways  among glen mankowski  gordon hartweger and tom kieffer  in addition  a special award was given to bob  bevo  nordmann  the foot center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury   you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing   benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies   but what this team had was a little different  the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability  they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do   several times i found the players pepping me up  where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk  wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say   dont worry  coach  well get em all right    the trio who shared the mostvaluable honors were introduced by bob broeg  sports editor of the postdispatch  kieffer  the only junior in the group  was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch  as well as his allround excellent play  mankowski  the ballhawking defensive expert  was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis us nationally televised victory  benington said   ive never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day   benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills  after the coach listed all the boys faults  hartweger said   coach before i leave here  youll get to like me   mrs benington admired gordons spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team  as hartweger accepted his silver bowl  he said   i want to thank coachs wife for talking him into letting me play   bob burnes  sports editor of the globedemocrat  presented bob nordmann with his award  bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time  within a week after the injury  suffered in st louiss victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament  nordmann was sitting on the bills bench doing what he could to help benington  on the clock given him was the inscription   for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball     other lettermen from the team that compiled a  record and finished as runnerup in the national invitation tournament were  art hambric  donnell reid  bill nordmann  dave harris  dave luechtefeld and george latinovich   this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future   benington pointed out   by winning against bradley  kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts  they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesnt take a super team to do it   st louis university found a way to win a baseball game  larry scherer last night pitched a nohit game  said to be the first in billiken baseball history  as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college    at crystal city  the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie  the tie was against southeast missouri last friday  scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double  len boehmer also was for with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple  st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at  against washington university at ligget field  the game opened a busy week for washington  the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at  tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy  ill  saturday  happy hitting if its true that contented cows give more milk  why shouldnt happy ball players produce more base hits   the two top talents of the time  mickey mantle and willie mays  have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which  to be frank about it  never have quite reached expectations  and thats meant as a boost  not a knock  mays and mantle  both year men at   have so much ability that  baseball men agree  theyve never hit the heights  their heights  that is  mantle  the bullnecked blond switchhitter  had one sensational triplecrown season    when he batted and also led the american league in home runs    and rbis    like the yankees slugger  mays  the terror of the giants  has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players  but not by  or for  willie  his best years were  when he hit with  homers and  when he belted  home runs  drove in  and stole  bases  now  apparently happier under new managers  mays and mantle  the perfect players  are behaving as though theyre going to pass those previous peaks  labor relations yes  we know  theyre professionals  men paid to play  and they shouldnt care how theyre handled  just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month  the truth is  though  that men react differently to different treatment  for that matter  stan musial is rare  possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers  reserving his opinions  but not his effort  mantle  its apparent  resented casey stengels attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility  the old man was almost too possessive  stengel inherited dimaggio  rizzuto  but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors  from joplin to new york  with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him  ol case wanted no  to be not only the best homerun hitter  but also the best bunter  baserunner and outfielder  stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats  inheriting a more mature mantle  who now has seen the sights on and off broadway  ralph houk quietly bestowed  no pun intended  the mantle of authority on mickey  the major decided that  rather than be led  the slugger could lead  and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far  the opinion continues here that with a game schedule  pitching spread thin through a team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr  mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books  babe ruths  homers of   four for alvin mays day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year  willies wonderful walloping sunday  four home runs  served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark  next to leo durocher  dark taught mays the most when he was a grassgreen rookie rushed up to the polo grounds  years ago this month  to help the giants win a dramatic pennant  romantic news concerns mrs joan monroe armour and f

supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions  there are about  officers and employees in this class   sufficient layoffs of union employees to bring about a  per cent cut in the union payroll expense  since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract  it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough  a b  o spokesman said  those union members kept on their jobs  therefore  will not take a cut in their wages  the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the layoffs must be

the disagreement was over what dr jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting  cites discrepancies mrs williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr jenkinss conversation and how they were written up for the boards approval   i hate to have these things come up again and again   dr jenkins commented as he made his suggestion   these are the boards minutes  ill write what you tell me to   for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago  it was about that time  a board member said later  that dr thomas g pullen  jr  state superintendent of schools  told dr jenkins and a number of other

parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them  should be  strictly enforced   admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority  the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas  not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive   recounting personal observations of clearance work  the

the fact that secrets of the dreadnought  and thereby of the american undersea fleet  were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier  but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navys chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare  capt george symonds  he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced

justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour  almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the

steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size  and also in complexity  allowing a single propeller to be used  the navy said  the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work  it was first tried out on a conventional submarine  the albacore  in   the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built  reputedly it could outrun  underwater  the fastest destroyers  it could  reputedly  go  miles without refueling and stay down more than a month  it was of the hunterkiller type  designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes

essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities  emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race  color

society  said today   it is like handing a loaded automatic to an yearold and telling him to run out and play   he commented  buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target  the fire ant   but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop   he said  the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming  there have even been serious errors in the u s forest service  whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training  he added   the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who  forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents  are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries   buchheister told the delegates  in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying  buchheister called for

land would be an  inviolate  sanctuary for all birds  animals and plants  seventeen years ago today  german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a v rocketbomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber  the world war   german bomber rolled down a runway and took off  the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip  this had never been done before  now a quietspoken  middleaged man  fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheeds missiles and space division at sunnyvale  where he played a key role in the development of the navys polaris missile  he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in    the first two pilots had crashed   he said   i had developed the machines and therefore knew them  it was time to go up myself   fiedler was then technical director of hitlers supersecret  reichenberg project   which remained unknown to the allies until after the war  about  of the special v rocketbombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead  the target was allied shipping  a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe  the success of the project depended upon fiedlers flight  squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rockets automatic guidance mechanism  the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude  at  feet  fiedler signaled  release   and started the roaring pulsejet engine  then streaked away from beneath the heinkel  to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck  hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of  mph  it was probably mans first successful flight in a missile   she flew beautifully   said fiedler   there was only one power control  a valve to adjust the fuel flow  i had exactly  minutes to get down to the test strip   using a steering system that controlled the modified rockets tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons  fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage  he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of  mph  fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown  and banked into the airfield  moments later the v skimmed across the landing strip  edging closer and closer to a touchdown  then in a streamer of dust it landed  fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles  the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb  pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water  striking below the waterline of individual ships  a crack corps of  pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers  but the project was halted before the end of the war  and the missiles later fell into allied hands  now a family man with three children  fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale  his spare time is spent in soaring gliders   its so quiet   he said   so slow

leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out   they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack  the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons   otherwise no peace is possible   governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger   therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency   a federal grand jury called  witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein    who collected big fees as a  labor

during the past week  for many reasons  the demand to buy shares in the dallasheadquartered company was tremendous  it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock   it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell  investors who wanted  shares in many cases ended up with   and customers who had put in a bid to buy  shares found themselves with  and counted themselves lucky to get that many  in fact  very few customers  anywhere in the nation  were able to get more than  shares  some dallas investment firms got only  shares  for all of their customers  a measure of how hot the stock was  can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began  the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of  a share  the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler  guerin  turner  the managing underwriter  was at  a share  and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around  a share  but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market  indeed  from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january  the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up  letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation  all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold   to the public at   with another  reserved for morton foods employes at  a share   there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering   we subscribe  shares of morton foods of texas  cable confirmation   it said translated  but egt could not let the swiss bank have even  shares  after it allotted shares to  underwriters and  selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone  but the result of it all was  egt partner dean guerin believes  an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation   i feel confident the stock will qualify for the  national list    he said  meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country  he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do  but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one   the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances  first  the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months  driving stocks of all kinds up  as a result  it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced  at roughly  times  earnings  to yield a little over  per cent on the cent anticipated dividend   second  the  potato chip industry  has caught the fancy of investors lately  and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks  frito and h w lay  on the market  both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months  both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at  and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup  and third  the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a  growth  industry in the public mind of late  foods  which long had been considered  recession resistant  but hardly dynamic stocks  have been acting like growth stocks  going to higher priceearnings ratios  the potato chip industry these days is growing  not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods  but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger  the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days  those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives  men with the abilities to last almost  years in the competitive survival of the fittest  but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms  so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock  and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito  all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is  now  if mortons newest product  a corn chip known as chipos  turns out to sell as well as its stock did  the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to  dallas and north texas is known worldwide as the manufacturing and

the kennedy administrations new housing and urban renewal proposals  particularly their effect on the federal housing administration  came under fire in dallas last week  the administrations proposals  complex and sweeping as they are  all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core  stated caron s stallard  first vicepresident of the mortgage bankers association of america  santa barbara   the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn   beryl w sprinkel  economist of harris trust  savings bank  chicago  predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn  california group  conference  another speaker  william h draper  jr  former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper  gaither  anderson  urged the us to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we wont be pushed around any more   he urged support for president kennedys requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations   not flash in pan  sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern   in view of the current expansion  which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months  but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in  nor as severe as in late  and    thesis refuted sprinkel strongly refuted the current neostagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth  declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence   rather than viewing the abortive recovery in  as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth   he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery   danger cited he cautioned that  the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation   the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it  even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in    the unsatisfactory  expansion  he said  was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike  sacrifices needed draper declared   as i see it  this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today  we must justify our heritage  we must be ready for any needed sacrifice   he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration  that  russia respects our show of strength  but that presently were not acting as we should and must   he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action  and noted that in war  you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do   while he declined to suggest  how  he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro   for unless we do were liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere  its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i dont believe we can permit that   new york  ap   stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery

the ambassador  that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and  unconventional wisdom   creations needed  as we look to the  billion economy that is predicted for  and the increase of about  in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal  management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed   peterson said   with this kind of new product logjam  the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically   the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past  but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the shortterm advantage which it often needs  nothing to fear peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas  he cited  as an example  how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs  by improving its production knowhow and technology  he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an allautomatic camera in germany  with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market  election of howard l taylor to

and tells of a sharp pickup in sales   weve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for  more  we sold only four pickers all last year   gus ehlers  competitor of mr houtz in this farm community  says his business since august  is running  above a year earlier   before then  my sales during much of the year had lagged behind  by    he says  though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business  farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas  paradoxically  the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output  although the administrations program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since   farmers  with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather  are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines  fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently  the higher price supports provided by the new legislation  together with rising prices for farm products  are pushing up farm income  making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery  seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly  above last year   in august our dealers sold  more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were  higher than last year   says mark v keeler  farm equipment vice president of international harvester co  for the year to date  sales of the companys farm equipment dealers still lag about  behind   two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states  two out of three report their sales since august  show sizable gains from a year earlier  with the increases ranging from  to   not all sections are showing an upswing  however   the droughtseared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend  the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry  the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally  farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products  more than  million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nations trucks  buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances  chemicals and other products  farmers are so eager for new machinery that theyre haggling less over prices than they did a year ago  dealers report   farmers arent as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale   says jack martin  who sells j i case tractors and implements in sioux city  iowa   this morning  we allowed a farmer  on the old picker he traded in on a new  model  last year  we probably would have given him  for a comparable machine   mr martin sold  tractors in august   in august of   he sold seven  dealers stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about  below a year ago  the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the countrys farm equipment manufacturers  for example  farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about  above a year earlier  mr keeler reports  tractor production at masseyferguson  ltd  of toronto in july and august rose to  units from  in the like period a year earlier  says john staiger  vice president  with the lower dealer inventories and the steppedup demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements  merritt d hill  ford motor co vice president  says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers  except for a few months in late  and early   retail farm equipment sales have trailed yearearlier levels since the latter part of   the rise in sales last winter was checked when the governments new feed grain program was adopted   the program resulted in a cutback of around  in planted acreage and  as a result  reduced the immediate need for machines  nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects  total farm output for this year is officially forecast at  of the  average  three points higher than the july  estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for   the government also is aiding farmers income prospects  agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers  billion in special subsidies and incentive payments  well above the record  billion of  and about double the  million of   price support loans may total another  billion this year  with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above   farmers gross income is estimated at  billion   billion above

midseptember for the third consecutive month  reaching  of the  average compared with  at midjuly  kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling  the supreme court decision in mid was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined  the company  in figuring its taxable earnings  deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products  such  depletion allowances   in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets  the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground  not to the revenue from finished products  a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the rulings impact  on prioryear returns still under review  for claymining companies that make brick and tile products  the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to  of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone  president kennedy  in signing the relief measure into law  stressed he regarded it as an exception   my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries   the president said  charitable deductions

contested  a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax  under federal law  on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation  louisiana  however  collected an

service disallowed the claim  invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was taxexempt income  the tax court rejected this view  it said the taxfreedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations  the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by

employed by a corporation her husband controls  for example  may be entitled to distributions under the companys pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage  she would be taxed on the pensions when received  of course  but the companys contributions would be taxfree  a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement  experts warn  is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income  in that event  they note  the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law  possible upshots  the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments  or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made  state

womentrodden chef  he is apt to rear back and claim his rights  ramsey  as smus food wrangler  buys enough groceries to serve  meals a week  tell that to the little wife when she moans at the womans burden   he also dishes up  snacks  and he operates three cafeterias in the student center  along with mcelvaney dining hall and the athletes tables  ramsey     and ruggedly slim  says   i cant remember when i didnt pester my mother to teach me to cook   he was in charge of the hockaday school meals from  to   before he moved to aj  and youll notice that in both places  there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line  what does he feed his smu football mastodons at the training table    mostly meat and potatoes  they have to have that gogogo without getting too fat   says ramsey  so he hides the mayonnaise  and to keep athletes stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress  he bans all highly flavored condiments  what do the pretty smu girls like on their plates    pretty much hamburger  hotdogs  steak and  at night  maybe pizza   says the handsome food expert   unfortunately  there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower   ramsey has stoked up harry truman  henry cabot lodge  the king of morocco  clement atlee and other shiny characters  once four tibetan monks  in their saffron robes  filed through the cafeteria line   they arent supposed to look at women  you know   ramsey recalled   what with all those pretty girls around  they had a hard time   chicken cadillac use one ounce chicken breast for each guest  salt and pepper each breast  dip in melted butter and roll in flour  place side by side in a inch deep baking pan  bake slowly about one hour at  f until lightly brown  add enough warmed cream  seasoned to taste with onion juice  to about half cover the chicken breasts  bake slowly at least onehalf hour longer  while this is baking  saute mushrooms  fresh or canned  in butter  sprinkle over top of chicken breasts  serve each breast on a thin slice of slowbaked ham and sprinkle with thompson seedless grapes   leave off the ham and you call it chicken pontiac  says ramsey   contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straightline modern but has sculptured pattern  many design facets  warmth  dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability  that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month  though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the s and s  two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated  but warm look in contemporary  these two  heritage and drexel  chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece  but a collection of correlated designs  each of which could stand alone  the heritage collection  to be shown by sangerharris and andersons studio  has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time  called perennian  to indicate its lasting  good today and tomorrow quality  the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces  walnut  wormy chestnut  pecan  three varieties of burl  handwoven philippine cane  ceramic tiles  marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence  the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors  brick or paneled walls  windows that bring in the outdoors  it is a collection with a customdesign look  offering simplicity with warmth  variety and vitality  the drexel collection  called composite  to be shown by titches offers a realistic approach to decorating  a mature modern that is a variation of many designs  rounded posts give a soft  sculptured look  paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches  table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia  a highlegged buffet provides easytoreach serving  a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end  recessed arched panels decorate a inch long chest  an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented  with a young  basic  functional group of chests  dressers and corner units and a canted headboard  the other bedroom has heavier styling  doorfronted dressers with acacia panels  a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror  colorful  bright eastman chromspun fabrics  with the magenta  pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite  the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles  design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexels fall  group  composite  the spiderleg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony  to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top  seethrough design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor  to bring warmth to the dining area  golden orange tones are used in the fabrics  dignity and comfort  in a contemporary manner  reflecting the best aspects of todays design  with substance and maturity  keynote the perennian collection from heritage  center panel  handscreened wood  actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases  mellow bronzygreengold fabrics and the gleam of copper and handcrafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile  the vagabonds are  on the road  again  members are on their way to saledo  not by stage coach  but in airconditioned cars  this coming

and took out some linen  needles and yarn to while away the long  idle days in budapest  now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and  at   she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles  her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in  and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna  there they continued their studies at the university  she in art  he in architecture  and there she had her first showing of tapestry work  theres a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today  what most people dont seem to realize  if they arent tied up with the thing as i am  is that  of the problem is transportation  i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until  at long last  both of my boys got squeezed into high school  it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school  getting to and from school was no problem  they either walked or were driven  now they go to a high school that is two miles away  one might think the problem would be similar  they could walk  ride on a bus or be driven  its much more complex than that  generally  they go to school with a girl named gloriana  who lives down the block  and has a car  this is a way of getting to school  but  i understand  it entails a certain loss of social status  a young man doesnt like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isnt even in a higher class than he is  and is also a girl   why dont you walk to school then    i suggested   my father walked  through two miles of snow  in illinois    did you    i was asked   no   i said   i didnt happen to grow up in illinois   i explained  however  that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom  i had to ride a streetcar two miles  sometimes the streetcar was late  sometimes there werent even any seats  i had to stand up  with the ladies  sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all  but wound up at the ocean  or some other dismal place  and had to spend the day there  ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then  when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car  she has to have at least one car herself  i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife  who is only a woman  even that isnt satisfactory  if they have to take any car  theyd rather take the big one  they say that when they take a car  gloriana doesnt take her car  but rides with them  but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her  so the little car isnt big enough  the logic of that is impeccable  of course  except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car  by my wife  when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself  the solution  naturally  is the bus  however  its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus  and its too hard on my legs  my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there  but thats hardly realistic  nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman  and hes already got an education  advance publicity on the los

formerly of panama   the geddes macgregors  formerly of scotland  and mr and mrs werner h althaus  formerly of switzerland  heres an idea for a childs room that is easy to execute and is completely charming  using puppets for lamp bases  most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies  and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action  rather than put away in boxes  displayed as lamps  the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent  to create such a lamp  order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop  measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket  allowing three to four inches above the puppets head  make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted  l   the foot of the  l  about three inches long  so that the puppet can hang directly under the light  pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet  suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base  in this way  you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position  with feet  or one foot  barely resting on the pedestal  if the puppets are of uniform size  you can change them in accord with your childs whims  although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony  it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a childs playtime  those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merrygoround  the scalloped edge is particularly appealing  todays trend toward furniture designs from americas past is teaching homeowners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era  a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions  in the background lurked the feeling  however  that these pieces  beautiful as they were  lacked the utilitarian touch  so juniors bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy  nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the  hard knocks   while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only  this isnt true of the many homemakers of the s  according to decorator consultant  leland alden  housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs  says mr alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had  an innate sense of the practical   solid investment there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop  down to earth  designs  or go out

sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from  to  pm sunday at first presbyterian church  at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged  a young real estate salesman  kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force  he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing  kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism  but never felt there was anything he  as an individual  could do about it  when he attended the christian anticommunist crusade school here about six months ago  jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it  the best approach  he figured  was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church  and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote  a biblically strong christianity  so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than  top teenagers and  adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program  this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation   a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack  another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami   and talks on how their christian faith

christ  the second half of the film  communism on the map  and the movie  operation abolition  also will be shown  response to the program has been so encouraging  kern said  that a citywide youth

bernard murray  the leningrad kirov ballet  which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house  is  i think  the finest  classical  ballet company i have ever seen  and the production of the petipatschaikowsky  sleeping beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing  this work is no favorite of mine  i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar  infantile  and reactionary aspect   that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was   that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people   that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of selfplagiarisms  all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation  precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous  but most of them end in  ova    eva   or  aya   in other words  no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet  it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests  miss omsk  miss pinsk  miss stalingr oops  skip it  these qualities alone  however  would not account for their success  and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this companys collective personality  it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet  ohthepainofit  that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety  is totally absent from the kirov  this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics  but  obviously  at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned  irina kolpakova  the princess aurora of fridays performance  would be a change for the better anywhere  at any time  no matter who had had the role before  she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on  and her dancing has a feminine suavity  lightness  sparkle  and refinement which are simply incomparable  hit alla sizova  who seems to have made a special hit in the east  was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner  yuri soloviev  was wonderfully virile  acrobatic  and poetic all at the same time  in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky  vladilen semenov  a fine  danseur noble    konstantin shatilov  a great character dancer   and inna zubkovskaya  an excellent lilac fairy  were other outstanding members of the cast  but every member of the cast was magnificent  the production  designed by simon virsaladze  was completely traditional but traditional in the right way  it was done with great taste  was big and spacious  sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes  but sumptuous in a muted  pastellike style  with rich  quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery  evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra  one containing excellent soloists  the violin solos by the concertmaster  guy lumia  were especially fine  but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity  mail orders are now being received for the

lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests   for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television  so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies  after all  this years movies are next years television shows  so i went to see  la dolce vita   it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality  all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film  if thats all the romans did  its a surprise to me that rome fell  after television   la dolce vita  seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night  i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week  i believe tv watchers will be bored   la dolce vita  has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western  week in  week out  there is more sex to be seen in  the adventures of ozzie and harriet   there is more decadence on   sunset strip   there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any privateeye series  in another respect  television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns  with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg  the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater  most of the emphasis has been placed on a  wild party  at a seaside villa  producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties   the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease  carried as far as a black slip    a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face   a frigid beauty  and three silly fairies  put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of  dull  apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall  what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining   as a moral shocker it is a dud  but this doesnt detract from its merit as an interesting  if not great  film  the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly   this is a long picture and a controversial one  but basically it is a moral  enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political  cultural and religious glories   and when they sell it to

presidents of the th century sent abroad for their furnishings  the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansions library  the suite has been in the same family since the early s  the gift is being presented by  heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey  whose famous estate   tranquility   was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover  n j  authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon  although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set  years ago  this acquisition is a matched  perfect set  consisting of two sofas six feet long  plus six sidechairs and two armchairs  the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedys fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home  it is the aids intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of americana  before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall  the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture  the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem  mass  an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in   the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace  it will be painted to match the paneling in

associates  announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york  include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel  both wellknown manhattan decorators  regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e barnes of boston  president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard  n c  but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music  at  pm the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians  students from the ages of  to  who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp  and to greet the  crippled  cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert  it was the first in the series of  concerts for young people by young people  to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house  she was not present yesterday  however  to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience  she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port  mass  and in his welcoming remarks  the president said he was representing her  as he approached the open bandstand  erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion  the band struck up the  star spangled banner  and followed it with  hail to the chief    i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band  and we are grateful to them   president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl  after paying tribute to the conductor and his whiteclad youthful students  president kennedy said   as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states  schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music   he added  i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field   displaying his knowledge of music  the new englandborn president remarked that  probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont  by young americans  and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers  and their work is being duplicated all across the united states   this is a great national cultural asset  and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me  representing as i do today my wife  to welcome all of you here today at the white house   as he left the bandstand to return to his office  the slender  suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests  he expressed surprise to learn that pretty  blonde patricia holbrook    of mount rainier  had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston   the nuns there do a wonderful work   the president commented  patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district  each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red  white and blue ribbon  they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff  many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience  and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected  henry hall wilson  a student at the music camp  years ago and now on the presidents staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives  turned guest conductor for a sousa march  the  stars and stripes forever   transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary  letitia baldrige  told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring  he said he contacted a friend  henry hall wilson  on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play  in the series  a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the student north carolina group to play the first concert  one of the most interested  students  on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house  was letitia baldrige  social secretary to

gallerys associate curator of education  miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at  pm  the brevard group of  arrived at the gallery at  pm  remaining for about  minutes  the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later  they decided that they thought rembrandts selfportrait made him look  sad    they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphaels  alba madonna  and  texture  in a monet painting of rheims cathedral  everybody had heard of van gogh  the french impressionist  gallery director john walker greeted the group  standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them  he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery  is the only museum in the country to have a fulltime music director  richard bales  im sure youve heard of him and his record   the confederacy    along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group  went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards  in  minutes  the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late th century  a few of them said they  preferred contemporary art   among the other artists  whose paintings were discussed were boucher  courbet  fra angelico  the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallerys rotunda fountain  because its on the second floor   that imposing  somewhat austere  and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at  th st nw

accused him of ignoring her  he in turn told her she demanded too much  they were both discouraged  disgusted and miserable  mary decided she had had enough  without any definite plan in mind  she

made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze  for crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev  mr kennedy replied   im hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground   the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable  but he was convinced that the realities of power  military  economic and ideological  were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting  he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy  last friday the white house announced  president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june  and   the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in eastwest relations  the heightened tension  in fact  had been a major factor in the presidents change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader  he was not going to vienna to negotiate  the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned  but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe  that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting  despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting  it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war  road to vienna the u s and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in  introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace  at the summit of the nations   the first time was in  when a fulldress big four summit meeting produced the  spirit of geneva   the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east  in  president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s  that meeting produced the  spirit of camp david   a spirit  it later turned out  that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement  on the third occasion  another big four summit session at paris a year ago  there was no problem of an illusory  spirit   premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s for the u incident  the episode tended to confirm the u s belief that propaganda  the hope of onesided concessions  and the chance to split the allies  rather than genuine negotiation  were the soviet leaders real aims in summitry  preinaugural position thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president  mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem  shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words   as long as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way  no amount of either smiles or toughness  neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates  can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations   the president had set for himself the task  which he believed vital  of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance  he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary  he wanted time  too  to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating  above all  he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchevs doorstep  attitude flexible at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader  ideally  he knew  it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels  but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting  provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it  it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war  to try to probe mr khrushchevs intentions and to make clear his own views  moreover  an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions  both elements  the caution about a meeting  the willingness eventually to hold one  were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia late in february  the letter  dated feb   was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk  siberia  on march   it dealt mainly with a broad range of eastwest issues  but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted  developments over the next two months  however  caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing  there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting  not because the international climate was improving  but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly  deadlock on tests the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva  the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman  east  west and neutral  directorate  and thus a veto  over the control machinery  in the u s  strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing  mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown  or even continued stalemate  would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament  there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons  particularly to communist china  the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent  moreover  moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies  including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos  mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements  or even negotiations  impossible  developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting  initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting  at the same time  there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader  as a result of those episodes  come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the wests ability and determination to resist communist pressure  in cuba  the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep  in laos  the picture was almost equally bad  u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be  neutralized  on soviet terms  beyond that  allied disagreement about military intervention in laos  despite warnings that they might do so  allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces  as a result  the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos  and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure  in the light of those events  there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself  ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive  he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out  the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin  iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back  it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may  made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future  mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may  after consultation with the allies  the response from london  paris and bonn was favorable  firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week  apparently at the insistence of the u s  the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the  informal  nature of the meeting  the washington announcement said   the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries  the meeting will  however  afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries   the outlook the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned  yearold veteran of the cold war who  in mr kennedys own words  is  shrewd  tough  vigorous  wellinformed and confident   and a yearold president  his birthday is may   with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy  the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval and disapproval  the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna  the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations  but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary  mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men  the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause  apart from the personal equation  another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit  premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway  this time the initiative came  in part at least  from washington  other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev  the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders  thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity  finally  there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord  there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world  if tests are to be resumed  the argument went  it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union  disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse  after cuba and laos  it was argued  mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness  perhaps even panic  and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds  moreover  the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments  the question was raised  for example  as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east  there are  so my biologist friends tell me  mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory  mollusks are a case in point  the shell  which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme  tended to cancel out the possibility of future development  though this may or may not be good biology  it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education  there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive  our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities  the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades  rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that  by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence  there is  however  one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture  viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect  we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university  but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project   certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy  official encouragement is one thing  but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds  american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning  they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made  diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility  all of this may be understandable enough  it is  however  in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise  yet for better or for worse  the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative  resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities  community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible  to understand the past history  and the future potential  of american catholic higher education  it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community  it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment  a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere  the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension  the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship  the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship  american catholic colleges and universities are  in a very real sense  the product of  private enterprise   the  private enterprise  of religious communities  had it not been for such private enterprise  diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees  there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility  the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the  family business   this  familycommunity  spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement  it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education  in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas  i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments  clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university  which is also coeducational  this is not an isolated example   this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough  it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot  apart  however  from the question of wasteful duplication  there is another aspect of the  family business  spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny  for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions  which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools  it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its  pursuit of excellence   at the earlier  preacademic excellence  stage of catholic education  the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis  but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training  the need for  outsiders  becomes more pressing  the problem is not merely that more  outside teachers  are needed but that a different brand is called for  commenting on the earlier stage  the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors  in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking  noted that the term  teacheremployee   as opposed to  eg   maintenance employee   was a not inapt description  today however  the  outsider  is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order  otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him  and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university  and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene  the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement  in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors  the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it   even with the best of intentions he  the president of the university  is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which  considered  as it must be by him  in individual terms  is inhomogeneous  mortal and of extremely varying temperament  interests and capabilities  it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are  in their opinion  identified with its highest good and  to use that oftrepeated phrase   the attainment of excellence    the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame  it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by  the organization which actually owns  it  becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished  outside  faculty  it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to  the organization which actually owns the university   this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension  but in any case  one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one   outside  faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business  there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university  in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel  word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession  much given to attending meetings and conferences  expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype  in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott  all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere  to appreciate the nature of the gamble  it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security  that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service  much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure  this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated  when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion  not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services  a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the  family   just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices  it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions  adequate compensation is indispensable  yet adequate compensation  and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place  broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university  religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification  there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that  at the college level  the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels  the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication  even informal debates over the luncheon table  are a contribution to the total good of the institution  but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation  the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the  ingroup  that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees  is  therefore  the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself  this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure  yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control  there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order  the first is a negative warning  there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority  in the case of academic personnel the  feeling  of participation can hardly be  faked   competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions  those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by  busywork  and ersatz decision making  in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all  in the notre dame report  reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to  luncheontable communication   in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of  participation   the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy  ie  members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution  have their own eating arrangements  sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws  once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws  there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions  the law must treat everybody equally  or  in the words of anatole france   the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich  as well as the poor  from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges   the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellans hearings into corruption in labormanagement relations and  later  into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites  the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program  in addition  disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill  it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages  but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike  business week  aug     reports that the united aircraft company  against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike  decided to keep its plants operating  the company incurred some  million of expenses attributable to four factors  advertising to attract new employees  hiring and training them  extra overtime  and defective work performed by the new workers  the company has billed the united states government for  of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractors business  rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee  the committee remains unresponsive  neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter   they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the antimonopoly laws to the unions  the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the antitrust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained  the antitrust laws inform a business that it must compete  but along completely undefined lines   it must play a game in which there never is a winner  the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law  hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy  let us look at the heavyelectricalgoods industry in which general electric  westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market  the industry is so structured that pricesetting by a multiproduct company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated  whether marginal or average pricing is applied  the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment  accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price  naturally  enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time  should these giants really flex their competitive muscles  they would become the only survivors in the industry  uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by  unfair competition   but if they show selfrestraint  they dont get the orders  under the circumstances  the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted  engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants  the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government  after the conviction  that general electric sign a wideopen consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows  in other words  the antitrust laws  designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday  wednesday and friday  become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday  thursday and saturday  and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday   the question might be asked   dont the managements of the heavyelectricalgoods manufacturers know these facts   why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas  throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter  expressing their complete confidence in the laws    the past usefulness of the antitrust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold  in the folklore of capitalism  back in   he wrote    p   the antitrust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations  and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure   p   antitrust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship   p   when corporate abuses were attacked  it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control  in this manner  every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the antitrust laws   pp   in any event  it is obvious that the antitrust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known  held together by some of the most fantastic ideas  all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government   this escape from control has led to managements evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while  a plea of nolo contendere  followed by a nominal fine  after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license   the penalties handed out in the electrical case  which included jail sentences  were unprecedented in antitrust prosecutions  perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities   if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market  quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest  a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle  however  one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the antitrust laws are effective and rational  quite clearly the antitrust laws are neither effective nor rational  and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union  those who favor placing trade unions under antitrust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform  before   individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english  the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in   implicit in the writing of section a of the national industrial recovery act  has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle  the wagner act  the tafthartley act and the landrumgriffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining  the basic purpose of an effective collectivebargaining system is the removal of wages from competition  if a union cannot perform this function  then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud  the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession  the problem must be faced squarely  if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn  unsupported  by the way  by any agricultural subsidy   then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them  human labor was exactly that  a commodity  in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury america  as early as   adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations   we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work   but many against combining to raise it   eighteenthcentury england  upon whose customs our common law was built  had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies  in   the boston house carpenters strike for a tenhour day was denounced by the organized employers  who declared   it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies   there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining  but against labor monopoly  the courts shared the opinion of the employers  in people vs fisher  justice savage of the new york supreme court declared   without any officious and improper interference on the subject  the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it   but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means   compare this statement of a nineteenthcentury judge with how congressman martin  according to the daily labor report of sept     defends the necessity of enacting antitrust legislation in the field of labor  if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages  production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages  hours and conditions of employment   senator mcclellan is proposing the application of antitrust measures to unions in transportation  his bill  allegedly aimed at hoffa  would amend the sherman  clayton and norrislaguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union  even a sister local in the same international  paradoxically  the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the antitrust act to labor in transportation  the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel  the action would not be deemed a violation of the antitrust act  indeed  it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the antitrust laws   for example  the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers  at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of antitrust legislation  a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the antimonopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates  the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies  it was most effective against trade unions  in the famous danbury hatters case  a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices  eg  trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer  the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment  in   the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the antitrust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity  the law could not suspend economics  labor remained a commodity  but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the antitrust laws  the courts  by interpretation  emasculated the act  in   the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company  the company sued under the antitrust laws  alleging that the unions activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce   what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise    the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce  the nation the threefront war at a closeddoor session on capitol hill last week  secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on us affairs abroad  afterward  tennessees democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen  what herter presented  said gore  was  not a very encouraging review   that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts  while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos  two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions    cuba  hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery  dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and drastic demand  within  hours  the us had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons  the embassy staff alone totaled  us citizens  plus  cuban employees   president eisenhower held an  am meeting with top military and foreignpolicy advisers  decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately   there is a limit to what the united states in selfrespect can endure   said the president   that limit has now been reached   through secretary herter  ike offered presidentelect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the

the us and latin america  see the hemisphere     laos  after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants  the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the prowestern government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam   in view of the present situation in laos   said the pentagons announcement   we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific   cutting short a holiday at hong kong  the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea  accompanied by a swarm of destroyers  plus troopships loaded with marines  on the uss island base of okinawa  task force   made up of army  navy  marine and air force units  got braced to move southward on signal  but by weeks end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration  see foreign news   and the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist  rather than a prowestern  government might be best for laos  french  indians  there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other coldwar fronts  political  economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic  mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war  and they were probably right   it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again   said one military man  but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground   at geneva in   to get the war in indochina settled  the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state  north viet nam  which then  predictably  became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos  the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the  geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement  saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west  he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj   the important thing from now on   he said   is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia   russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana  russian intrigue in the congo  and russian arms drops in laos  using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo  made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time  soviet premier khrushchev sent new years hopes for peace to presidentelect kennedy  and got a cool acknowledgment in reply  considering the state of the whole world  the cold wars three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous   but  in senator gores words  it was  not a very encouraging  situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day  the congress turmoil in the house as the th congress began its sessions last week  liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor  the liberal pressure bloc  which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group  had fought the committee before  and had always lost  this time  they were much better prepared and organized  and the political climate was favorable  they had the unspoken support of presidentelect kennedy  whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck  and counting noses  they seemed to have the votes to work their will  deadly deadlock  there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee    to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservativeliberal deadlock  or   to remove one of the conservatives  namely mississippis term william meyers colmer  pronounced calmer   caucusing  the liberals decided to go after colmer  which actually was the more drastic course  since seniority in the house is next to godliness  a dour  gangling man with a choppy gait  colmer looks younger than his  years  has gradually swung from a moderate  internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative  he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project  unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents  he is  of course  a segregationist  but he says he has never made an  antinegro  speech  for  years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee  there his vote  along with those of chairman howard smith  the courtly virginia judge  and the four republican members  could and often did produce a  deadlock that blocked farout  democraticsponsored welfare legislation  a tactic often acceptable to the rayburnjohnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes   equal treatment  there was sufficient pretext to demand colmers ouster  he had given his lukewarm support to the antikennedy electors in mississippi  reprisals are not unheard of in such situations  but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons  in  the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their  rebellion against harry truman  and in   after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in   his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments  although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage   in the heat of the anticolmer drive last week  judge smith threatened reprisal against powell  said he   we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here    but speaker sam rayburn  after huddling in palm beach with presidentelect kennedy  decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee  and that he was the only man who could do anything effective  in a tense  closeddoor session with judge smith  rayburn attempted to work out a compromise  to add three new members to the rules committee  two democrats  including one southerner  and one republican   smith flatly rejected the offer  and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels  the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news  he would lead the fight to oust colmer  whom he is said to regard as  an inferior man   news of rayburns commitment soon leaked out  when missouris clarence cannon got the word  he turned purple   unconscionable    he shouted  and rushed off to the speakers room to object   a dangerous precedent    cannon  a powerful  conservative man  brought welcome support to the smithcolmer forces  as chairman of the appropriations committee  he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal porkbarrel projects  sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally  georgias carl vinson  chairman of the armed services committee  threat of war  as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses  it became clear that judge smith could lose  his highest count of supporters numbered   and he needed nearly twice that number to control the member democratic caucus  the liberals  smelling blood  were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes  in the democratic committee on committees  in the full party caucus  and on the floor of the house  before they could oust colmer   one big question  if colmer was to be purged  what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors    in all three arenas  they seemed certain of victory  especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash  but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war  if the southerners were sufficiently aroused  they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships  leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated  unworkable party  with that possibility in mind  arkansas wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees  and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of facesaving compromise   here are two old men  mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone   said a house democratic leader   one wants a little more power  and the other doesnt want to give up any   battle in the senate the senate launched the th congress with its own version of an ancient liberalconservative battle  but in contrast with the houses guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guides speech  question at issue  how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate  and thereby cut off legislationdelaying filibusters   a wideranging  bipartisan force  from minnesotas democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall  was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats  who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills  new mexicos clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senates notorious rule  to allow threefifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate  instead of the current hardtoget twothirds  fair dealer humphrey upped the ante  asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators  georgias dick russell objected politely  and the battle was joined  privately  the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage  privately  they also admitted that their hopes for clint andersons threefifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon  in  nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress  and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding  armed with the nixon opinion  the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week  hopefully  the perennial battle of rule  then would be fought to a settlement once and for all  republicans last act since election day  vice president richard nixon had virtually retired  by his own wish  from public view  but with the convening of the new congress  he was the public man again  presiding over the senate until john kennedys inauguration  one day last week  nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote  and then to make  sufficient declaration  of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight  presidential election  nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace  then went beyond the required  sufficient declaration    this is the first time in  years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated   he said  the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves  gary player  the small  trim south african  was the eventual winner  but in all his  years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap  arnold palmer  the defending champion  lost his title on the nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief   just when you think you have it licked  this golf course can get up and bite you   player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament  and that is just what happened on the last few holes  the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer  player was the first to feel its teeth  after playing a splendid first nine holes in   two strokes under par  on this fifth and final day of the tournament  sundays fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed   players game rapidly fell to pieces  he bogeyed the th  after a journey through woods and stream he doublebogeyed the th  he bogeyed the th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a overpar  and a hole total of   as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course  player was almost in tears  he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer  by then playing the th hole  was leading him by a stroke  palmer had started the round four strokes behind player  and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes  now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf  when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the nd hole  he seemed to have the championship won  but the seveniron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression  in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green  past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower  afterwards  palmer told charlie coe  his lastround partner  that he simply played the hole too fast  he did seem hasty on his second and third shots  but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out  giving palmer a chance to recover his composure  which he had quite visibly lost  when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot  he overshot the hole by  feet  palmer was now putting merely for a tie  and player  who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment  stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt  palmers  for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro  but it was barely good enough for a secondplace tie with coe  the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur  who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years  refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight   end at seven until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters  four last year and three this  without ever being out of first place  as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing oneoverpar   this remarkable record was still intact  thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of  and   his threeround total of  was three strokes better than the next best score  a  by bill collins  the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long  but palmer knew  as did everybody else at augusta  that his streak was about to be broken  half an hour after he finished his round  player holed out at the th green with a  and a threeround total of   four strokes ahead of palmer  more than a streak had ended  long after the erratic climate and the washedout final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes  the  masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player  unlike most such sports rivalries  it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously  although this was not exactly the case  when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmers towering prestige  as if to confirm his stature  he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments  player won only one  but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago  player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars  and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere  on the final round at pensacola  the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and  although it was far from obvious at the time  the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come  on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and  as it turned out  neither won it  but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour  player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer  he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous  to palmers   thereafter  until the masters  player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami  when they reached augusta last week  together they had won five of the  tournaments to date  instant rivalry on thursday  the first day of the masters  the contest between palmer and player developed instantly  it was a dismal  drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course  the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft  so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flagstick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences  palmers underpar  got him off to an early lead  which he shared with bob rosburg  but player was only one stroke back  with a   even so  it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators  unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever  that this tournament was to be  essentially  a match between palmer and player  a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus  the spectacular young amateur  who had a    or ken venturi  who had a somewhat shaky  but was bound to do better   or rosburg  whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augustas treacheries   or even old byron nelson  whose excellent  made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf   on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe   on friday  a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly  the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus  rosburg had started early in the day  and by the time palmer and player were on the course  separated  as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend  by about half an hour  they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg  who ended with a   was not having a good day  as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman  his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender  player began with a birdie on the first hole  added five straight pars and then another birdie at the th  on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament  he birdied the th  the th and the th  five birdies  one bogey and  pars for a   starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle  palmer birdied the nd  the th  the th and the th  four birdies  one bogey and  pars for a   the roar of palmers gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta  only to be answered moments later by the roar of players gallery for a similar triumph  at one point late in the day  when palmer was lining up a foot putt on the th  a thunderous cheer from the direction of the th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole  without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed  although he later admitted that he had  palmer proceeded to sink his footer  and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply  the boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course  it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence  the bad luck that can so often mar a wellplayed round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions  bob jones played that way  byron nelson did  hogan did  and last week at the masters palmer and player did  as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest  it was players superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead  this day palmer had started first  as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was  under par for the day  player immediately proceeded to follow suit  in fact  he went on to birdie the th and th as well  to go  under par for the first eight holes  but players real test came on the ninth hole  a downhill dogleg to the left measuring  yards  he hit a poor tee shot  pulling it off into the pine woods separating the th and first fairways  having hit one of the trees  the ball came to rest not more than  yards out  player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the th fairway and settling for a bogey   or gambling  the latter involved hitting a full fourwood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse  hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered th green   i was hitting the ball well   player said later   and i felt strong  when youre playing like that youd better attack   player attacked with his fourwood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget  it struck the th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge  from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par   palmer  meanwhile  had been having his troubles  they started on the th hole  a yard par  on this day the wind had switched degrees from the northwest to the southeast  and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days  at the th tee palmer chose to hit a oneiron when a threewood was the proper club  so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green  his bogey  on this hole and subsequent bogeys at  and  along with a birdie at  brought him back to even par  starting the second nine  palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it  when mickey charles mantle  the new york yankees man of muscle  drives a home run  feet into the bleachers  his feat touches upon the sublime  when roger eugene maris  mantles muscular teammate  powers four home runs in a doubleheader  his performance merits awe  but when tiny  pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels  who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because  as a teammate explained   the other team thought no one was out there   hits seven home runs in four months  three more than his total in     and    his achievement borders on the ridiculous  this is baseball   this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous  it is the year when    amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and  in unprecedented style  delivered consecutive grandslam home runs      willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammates bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game      the milwaukee braves tied a majorleague record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them   and    catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat  two of them as a pinchhitter  pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats  the shrinking strike zone  and the fact that the knockdown pitch is now illegal  experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion  whatever the reasons  not in  years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records  homerun division  of all the records in peril  one stands apart  dramatic in its making  dramatic in its endurance  and now  doubly dramatic in its jeopardy  this  of course  is baseballs most remarkable mark  the  home runs hit in  by the incorrigible epicure  the incredible athlete  george herman  babe  ruth of the yankees  since   fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruths record and each  in turn  has been thwarted  what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruths amazing september surge  in the final month of the  season  he hit seventeen home runs  a closing spurt never matched  double threat  always  in the abortive attacks upon ruths record  one man alone  a jimmy foxx   in   or a hank greenberg   in   or a hack wilson   in    made the bid  but now  for the first time since lou gehrig  with  home runs  spurred ruth on in   two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on   their names are mantle and maris  their team is the yankees  and their threat is real  after  games in   ruth had  home runs  after  games in   mickey mantle has   roger maris   extend mantles and mariss present paces over the full  schedule of  games  and  mathematically  each will hit more than  home runs  this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them  to better ruths mark  neither needs a spectacular september flourish  all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september  and he will establish a new record  in ruths day  and until this year  the schedule was  games  baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruths record will remain official unless it is broken in  games    even on the basis of  games  this is the ideal situation   insists hank greenberg  now vicepresident of the chicago white sox   it has to be easier with two of them  how can you walk maris to get to mantle    roommates  neither mantle nor maris  understandably  will predict  home runs for himself  although both concede they would like to hit   they stick primarily to the baseball players standard quote   the important thing is to win the pennant   but one thing is for certain  there is no dissension between mantle  the american leagues most valuable player in  and   and maris  the mvp in   each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs   i hope roger hits    mantle says   and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs   and i hope i hit     the sluggers get along so well in fact  that with their families at home for the summer  mantles in dallas  mariss in kansas city   they are rooming together  mantle  maris  and bob cerv  a utility outfielder  share an apartment in jamaica  long island  not far from new york international airport  the three pay  a month for four rooms  kitchen  dining room  living room  and bedroom   with airconditioning and new modern furniture  mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom   maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room  they divide up the household chores  cerv does most of the cooking  breakfast and sandwich snacks  with dinner out   mantle supplies the transportation  a white  oldsmobile convertible   and maris drives the minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium  mantle  maris  and cerv probably share one majorleague record already  among them  they have fifteen children  eight for cerv  four for mantle  and three for maris  as roommates  teammates  and homerun mates  mantle    who broke in with the yankees ten years ago  and maris    who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago  have strikingly similar backgrounds  both were scholastic stars in football  basketball  and baseball  mantle in commerce  okla  maris in fargo  nd    as halfbacks  both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma   sometimes in the minors   maris recalls   i wished i had gone to oklahoma    to an extent  the two even look alike  both have blue eyes and short blond hair  both are  feet tall and weigh between  and  pounds  but mantle  incredibly muscular  he has a inch neck   looks bigger  with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders  both must have their clothes made to order  maris purchases  suits from simpsons in new york  mantle  more concerned with dress  buys his suits four at a time at neimanmarcus in dallas and pays as much as  each  light reading  neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual  but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus  henry millers  tropic of cancer   mantle so appreciated millers delicate literary style that he broadened teammates minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips  mantle is not normally given to public speaking  or  for that matter  to private speaking   what do you and mickey talk about at home    a reporter asked maris recently   to tell you the truth   maris said   mickey dont talk much   this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer  what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris  under constant pressure from writers and photographers  are trying to be cooperative  of the two  mantle is by nature the less outgoing  maris the more outspoken  but last week  when a reporter was standing near mantles locker  mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote   see that kid    he said  pointing to a darkhaired yearold boy   thats  yogi  berras  ill never forget one time i struck out three times  dropped a fly ball  and we lost the game  i came back  sitting by my locker  feeling real low  and the kid walks over to me  looks up  and says   you stunk    maris  in talking to reporters  tries to answer all questions candidly and fully  but on rare occasions  he shuns newsmen   when ive made a dumb play   he says   i dont want to talk to anyone  im angry   by his own confession  maris is an angry young man  benched at tulsa in   he told manager dutch meyer   i cant play for you  send me where i can play    meyer sent him to reading  pa   benched at indianapolis in   he told manager kerby farrell   im not learning anything on the bench  play me    farrell did  and maris led the team to victory in the little world series    thats the way i am   he says   i tell people what i think  if youre a good ballplayer  youve got to get mad  give me a team of nine angry men and ill give you a team of nine gentlemen and well beat you nine out of ten times   idols idols  one good indication of the two mens personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes  mariss was ted williams   when i was a kid   maris told a sportswriter last week   i used to follow williams every day in the box score  just to see whether he got a hit or not    when you came up to the majors  did you seek out williams for advice     are you kidding    said maris   youre afraid to talk to a guy you idolize   mantles hero was joe dimaggio   when mickey went to the yankees   says mark freeman  an exyankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver   dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker  just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man  this hero of his  but dimaggio never said a word  it crushed mickey  he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star  this never would be said of him   mantle has kept the vow  among all the yankees  he is the veteran most friendly to rookies  neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else  if laying ties on a railroad track  which he once did for  an hour  paid more than playing right field for the yankees  maris would lay ties on a railroad track  if working in a zinc mine  which he once did for  cents an hour  paid more than playing center field for the yankees  mantle would work in a zinc mine  but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts  mantle and maris concentrate on baseball  they try to play baseball the best they can  each is a complete ballplayer  mantle  beyond any question  can do more things well    one of the reasons they get along fine   says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men   is that both realize mantle is headandshoulders above maris    hitting  mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both lefthanded and righthanded  maris only lefthanded  they both possess near classic stances  dug in firmly  arms high  set for fierce swings  mantle is considerably better hitting for average   fourth in the league  to for maris so far this year   both are good bunters  maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues   mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base  both have brilliant speed  mantle was timed from home plate  batting lefthanded  to first base in  seconds  faster than any other major leaguer   maris ran the yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio  the swift  basestealing shortstop of the white sox  both are good  daring fielders  mantle covers more ground   mariss throwing arm is stronger  yet with all their skills  the appeal of mantle and maris in  comes down to one basic  the home run  with this ultimate weapon  the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season   american league expansion created  inevitably  weaker teams  only two teams in each league  the yankees and detroit  the dodgers and cincinnati  are battling for first place  appropriately  the emphasis on the home run  at a peak this year  came into being at baseballs lowest moment  in   as the startling news that the  white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out  fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball  something was needed to revive interest   the something was the home run  into

most people in his own home town of pittsburgh  there the name vaguely connotes newrich wealth  a reputation for eccentricity  and an ardor for collecting art  last week  in the german city of dusseldorf  g david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause  on display were  firstclass paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection  and every single one of them was up for sale  like philadelphias late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public  time  jan    thompson  at   is something of a legend in his own lifetime  he made his fortune during world war   when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom  even before he hit big money  he had begun buying modern paintings  he gave the impression of never having read a word about art  but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best  he was able to smell a bargain  and a masterpiece  a continent away  and the museum of modern arts alfred barr said of him   i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didnt know about   he might barge into a gallery  start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting  he could be lavishly generous with friends  cab drivers and bellboys  but with dealers he was tough  he bought up cezannes  braques  matisses  legers  a splendid picasso series  more than  giacometti sculptures  he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world  all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stones throw  outside pittsburgh  and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them  two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city  but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum  pittsburgh turned him down  just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years  he went then to a yearold basel art dealer named ernst beyeler  with whom he had long been trading pictures  last year beyeler arranged to sell  worth of klees to the state of north rhinewestphalia  which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built  last week most of the other prizes  once offered to pittsburgh  went on the block  at the opening of the dusseldorf show  thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time  in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them  some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town  thompson himself said   i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures   break in georgia the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color  but in all its  years  not a single negro student has entered its classrooms  last week federal district judge william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a  qualified  negro boy and girl  their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education  from kindergarten through graduate school  in georgia  and in alabama  mississippi and south carolina as well  for  months  hamilton holmes    and charlayne hunter    had tried to get into the university  they graduated together from atlantas turner high school  where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third  the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts  but was careful never to mention the color of their skins  holmes went to atlantas morehouse  negro  college  where he is a b student and star halfback  charlayne studied journalism at detroits wayne state university  last fall  after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court  judge bootle ordered them to apply again  charlayne was  tentatively  admitted for next fall  after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state  but holmes was rejected again  on the basis of his record and interview   the evidence in court was testimony about the interview  which for holmes lasted an hour  although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation  holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution  or a  beatnik parlor or teahouse   no  said he  but officials still called him  evasive   they also said he lied in saying that he had never been  arrested   their reason  holmes once paid a  speeding fine  had his license suspended  negro lawyers dug into the records of  white students  found that many were hardly interviewed at all  and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes  the real reason for his rejection  they argued  is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school  judge bootles decision   the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color   the state will appeal  but few think it will actually try to close the university   surprised and pleased   students holmes and

 it fell to chancellor kimpton  now a standard oil  indiana  executive  to spend his nineyear reign tidying up chicago after the year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins  he threw out some of hutchins more wildly experimental courses  raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to   nearly doubled endowment to  million  but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order  some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era  at caltech  geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the schools famous biology division since   but he has shown a sixthsense ability to spot  recruit and excite able researchers  and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speechmaking  beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters   he avidly reads the wall street journal  and took delight in driving a  model a ford for  years  then selling it for   a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end  but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date  and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away  the man was king leopold   of the belgians  who in  concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good  by force  he took under his protection  or stole   square miles of wilderness in central africa  this is an area nearly as large as western europe   and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity  its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings   they were determined by the points at which leopolds explorers and gunmen got tired of walking  the population of the congo is  million  divided into at least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking  separate dialects  the religions of the people include christianity  mohammedanism  paganism  ancestor worship and animism  the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate  the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars  to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case   it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done  or failed to do  in the congo since   at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property  but by  its record of brutality had touched the national conscience  the belgian government itself took over administration  commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism  one definition of paternalism is  the principle or practice  on the part of a government  of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children   the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned  only their judgment  ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time  but when the colony received independence in  the congolese child  if one imagines him to have been born in   was  and had until then been treated as an infant  the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo  which is rich in copper  tin  cobalt  manganese  zinc  and uranium  and cotton and palm oil  the colony was administered from brussels  with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote  the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock  in inside africa  john gunther describes one of these  the societe generale  as  the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if  let us say  the house of morgan  anaconda copper  the mutual life insurance company of new york  the pennsylvania railroad  and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together  with the united states government as a heavy partner   had they been truly ruthless  the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion  but they were not  they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes   their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent   they put much effort into public housing  they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food  but instead of delivering the ration  either in actual commodities or in cash  at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month  the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often  would not the children  if they received all their food on the first day of the month  eat it up immediately  and later go hungry   the belgians also placed great emphasis on education  during the s there were as many as  schools in the congo  but almost all the schools were primary  the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of  la chatte  and  le chien  and write his name  some schools were technical  the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land  and trained many  but they did not believe in widespread secondary education  much less in college  it was their conviction that the people should be  brought up together   a grade at a time  until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history  economics and political science  indeed  the belgians discouraged higher education  fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest  when the congo received its independence in  there were  among its  million people  exactly  university graduates  why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it   in one large oversimplification  it might be said that the belgians felt  far too late  the gale of nationalism sweeping africa  they lacked time to prepare the congo  as the british and french had prepared their colonies  the congolese were clamoring for their independence  even though most were unsure what it meant   and in brussels  street crowds shouted   pas une goutte de sang     not one drop of blood     the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue   rather than teach where teaching was not wanted  they would wash their hands of the mess  it is hard to blame them for this  yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless  as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than  political parties  or approximately eight for each university graduate  there were four principal ones  first  there were those congolese  among them joseph kasavubu  who favored splitting the country into small independent states  balkanizing it  second  there were those  moise tshombe  who favored nearbalkanization  a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority  with much power residing in the states  third  there were those  notably patrice lumumba  who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government  and fourth  there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up  however  the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting  a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo  immediately after independence  was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration  they had divided the congo into six provinces  leopoldville  kasai  kivu  katanga  equator and eastern  unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings  thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other  and to them independence meant an opportunity for war  the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable westernstyle form of government  there were to be a president and a premier  and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces  wellwishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations  if internal frictions arose  they could be handled by the man congolese army  the force publique  which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians  the president  joseph kasavubu  seemed an able administrator and the premier  patrice lumumba  a reasonable man  twentyfour hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other  presently the wellarmed members of the force publique  many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes  erupted in mutiny  rioting  raping and looting  terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country  the belgian government decided to act  and on july  dispatched paratroops to the congo  on july  the head of the mineralrich province of katanga  moise tshombe  announced that his province had seceded from the country  confusion became chaos   each succeeding day brought new acts of violence  lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians  and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them  on july  the security council  with france and great britain abstaining  voted the resolution which drew the un into the congo  vague in wording  it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretarygeneral  to take the necessary steps to provide the  congolese  government with such military assistance as may be necessary  until  through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations  the national security forces may be able  in the opinion of the government  to meet fully their tasks   secretarygeneral hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were to come from african  or at least nonwhite  nations  certainly not from the us  russia  great britain or france  he quickly called on ghana  tunisia  morocco  guinea and mali  which dispatched troops within hours  ultimately the un army in the congo reached a top strength of   including about  from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden  who were the only whites  it took the un three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo  the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed un efforts  the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems  he frequently announced that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with the belgians  and appealed to russia for help   however  there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist  before appealing to the un or to russia  he first appealed to the us for military help  and was rejected   lumumba further complicated the uns mission by initiating small  wars  with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which  under albert kalonji  wanted to secede as well  meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo  sending lumumba equipment for his  wars   dispatching  technicians  and even threatening  on occasion  to intervene openly  but by the end of the threemonth period  in october   something approaching calm settled on the congo  president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him  lumumba fired kasavubu  control of the government  such control as there was and such government as there was  passed into the hands of joseph mobutu  chief of staff of the congolese army  mobutu promptly flung out the russians  who have not since played any significant part on the local scene  although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york  the belgians  at least officially  departed from the congo as well  withdrawing all of their uniformed troops  but they left behind them large numbers of officers  variously called  volunteers  or  mercenaries   who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga  the seceded province which  according to tshombe  holds  of the mineral wealth of the entire country  from october  to february   the un forces in the congo took little action  there was no directive for it  the security councils resolution had not mentioned political matters  and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation  whether to unify it  federalize it or balkanize it  during the fivemonth lull  civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo  in february the murder of patrice lumumba  who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe  again stirred the un to action  on feb  the council passed another resolution urging the taking of  all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo  including the use of force  if necessary  in the last resort   although the resolution might have been far more specific  it was considerably tougher than the earlier one  it also urged that the un eject  and prevent the return of  all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers   ordered an investigation of lumumbas death   urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army  the presidency  talking and listening though president john f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloys unexpected report from khrushchev  his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week  high up on the presidents priority list was the thorny question of bizerte  on this issue  the president received a detailed report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson  who had just returned from paris  and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search for a facesaving way  for both paris and tunis  out of the imbroglio  ideally  the president would like the french to agree on a  status quo ante  on bizerte  and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base  to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems  mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend  the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no  man in the tunisian government  defense minister bahi ladgham  who flew to washington last week to seek us support  the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable  through ladgham  mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba   and one us official said   the key question now is which side picks up the phone first   on the latin american front  the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the interamerican economic and social council  which the president himself had originally hoped to attend   main purpose of the meeting  to discuss president kennedys alliance for progress  and that was not all  in conferences with nationalist chinas dapper  diminutive vice president chen cheng  mr kennedy assured chiang kaisheks emissary that the us is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations  chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia   however the president  who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow  would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer mongolias admission comes to a vote  the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid  to africa  he sent his most trusted adviser  his brother  attorney general robert kennedy  on a goodwill mission to the ivory coast  all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs   in effect  he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared   we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are

nation  the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass   to   the largest peacetime defense budget in us history  with the money all but in hand  however  the administration indicated that  instead of the  more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested  the armed forces would be increased by only   the  holdback   as pentagon mutterers labeled it  apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and  thus  the new funds spent prudently  in all  the senate signed a check for  billion  which not only included the extra  billion requested the week before by president kennedy  but tacked on  million more than the president had asked for   the senate  on its own  decided to provide additional b and other longrange bombers for the strategic air command   the house  which had passed its smaller appropriation before the presidents urgent call for more  was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order  in other areas  congressional action last week included  the senate  by voice vote  and the house  by   passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign  not too unhappily  the senate also voted  billion to finance the governments health  welfare  and labor activities  debate on the allimportant foreignaid bill  with its controversial longrange proposals  had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend  white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact  food  stew a la mulligatawny most members of the us senate  because they are human  like to eat as high on the hog as they can  but  because they are politicians  they like to talk as poormouth as the lowliest voter  as a result  ever since  when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building  the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food  even while they opposed every move that might improve it  over the years  enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes  the menu has pursued its drab allamerican course  individual senators  with an eye to the voters back home  occasionally introduced smelts from michigan  softshell crabs from maryland  oysters from washington  grapefruit from florida  but plain old bean soup  served daily since the turn of the century  at the insistence of the late sen fred dubois of idaho   made clear to the citizenry that the senates stomach was in the right place

reports on operation of the turnpikes  longterm trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward  higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues  result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative  things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds  traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing  that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates  as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes  investors who bought tollroad bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments  another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these taxexempt bonds  other taxexempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february   according to standard  poors average  on balance  prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then  however  in the same threemonth period  tollroad bonds  as a group  have bucked this trend  on these bonds  price rises since february  easily outnumber price declines  taxfree returns  investors  however  still see an element of morethanordinary risk in the tollroad bonds  you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page  many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of  per cent  or very close to that  and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to  or beyond  the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds  that  per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds  its not much more  in fact  than the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds  for investors whose income is taxed at high rates  though  a taxfree yield of  per cent is high  it is the equivalent of  per cent for an unmarried investor with more than  of income to be taxed  or for a married couple with more than  of taxed income  swelling traffic  a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent month period  ending in february or march  shows what is happening  the report is based on a survey by blyth  company  investment bankers  nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period  and there is the bright note  the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in  and early in  as a result of business recession  many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter  indication  the longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward  look  for example  at the ohio turnpike  traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february  as compared with those same months in   then march brought an  per cent rise in net revenues  after operating costs  as a result  the roads net revenues in the  months ending march  were  per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds  that was up from  per cent in the preceding  months  that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike  operating revenues were off in the first three months of   but up for the  months ending in march  costs were held down  despite a bitter winter  for the year  the road earned  per cent of its interest costs  against  per cent in the preceding period  the roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston  slow successes  some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do  the mile illinois state toll highway  for example  was not opened over its entire length until december    in the  months ended in february    the highway earned enough to cover  per cent of its interest load  with the remainder paid out of initial reserves  in the  months ended in february    this highway earned  per cent of its interest  that improvement is continuing  in the first two months of   earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up  per cent from early   success  for many turnpikes  has come hard  traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates  in these cases  the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases  or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways  many rate increases already have been put into effect  higher tolls are planned for july     on the richmondpetersburg  va  turnpike  and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study  easier access  progress is being made  too  in improving motorists access to many turnpikes  the kansas turnpike offers an illustration  net earnings of that road rose from  per cent of interest requirements in calendar  to  per cent in the  months ended feb     further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in   with the opening of a new bypass at wichita  and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city  kans  and kansas city  mo  meanwhile  there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years  for some roads  troubles  investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals  traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike  if nothing is done  the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in   west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months  and  despite recent improvement in revenues  holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same  these  however  are exceptions  the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement  its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full  already  however  several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins  many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point  a top american official  after a look at europes factories  thinks the us is in a  very serious situation  competitively  commerce secretary luther hodges  accompanied by a member of our staff  on may  toured plants of two of italys biggest companies  fiat  the auto producer  and olivetti  maker of typewriters and calculating machines  our staff man cabled from turin as follows   follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant  and you learn this   one  modern equipment  much of it supplied under the marshall plan  enables fiat to turn out  cars a day  about half of these are exported   two  wage costs are a fraction of the us costs  a skilled worker on the assembly line  for example  earns  a week   three  labor troubles are infrequent  fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years   said secretary hodges   its a tough combination for the us to face   olivetti had a special interest for hodges  olivetti took over underwood  the us typewriter maker  in late   within a year  without reducing wages  underwoods production costs were cut one third  prices were slashed  the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled   the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout  modern machinery  the firm is designconscious  salesconscious  advertisingconscious   hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the us  the inflow of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments   hodges predicted   i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the us  there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas    foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports  the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines  important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these  an international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy  chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting  the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years  point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first  need encouragement to get on their feet  if they have trouble exporting  international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would  idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible  at the same time  another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports  especially dumping of specific products  to highwage textileproducing countries  japan  since   has been  voluntarily  curbing exports of textiles to the us  hong kong  india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the  lancashire pact   none of these countries is happy with these arrangements  the japanese want to increase exports to the us while they have been curbing shipments  they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market  hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain  while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly  the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons  the kennedy hope is that  at the conference or through bilateral talks  the lowwage textileproducing countries in asia and europe will see that  dumping  practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas  gradual  controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what president kennedy wants  this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products  its an important clue to washington thinking  note  too  that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us textile industry   get competitive or get out   in veiled terms  thats what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry  the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines  where modernization doesnt seem feasible  special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed  government research will look into new products and methods  import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved  but the kennedy administration doesnt favor import quotas  rather  they are impressed with the british governments success in forcing  and helping  the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products  whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries  among the highestpaid workers in the world are us coal miners  yet us coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water  steel company of wales  a british steelmaker  wants to bring in virginia coal  cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively  especially in foreign markets  virginia coal  delivered by ship in wales  will be about  a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines  us coal is cheap  despite high wages  because of widespread mechanization of mines  wide coal seams  attactive rates on ocean freight  many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting  narrow and very deep  productivity of us miners is twice that of the british  welsh coal miners  communistled  are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal  they threaten to strike  the british government will have to decide whether to let us coal in  the british coal industry is unprofitable  has large coal stocks it cant sell  every library borrower  or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fivecent fiction rentals  knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically   im sorry  but we dont have that book  there wouldnt be much demand for it  im afraid   behind this reply  and its many variations  is the everpresent budget problem all libraries must face  from the largest to the smallest  what to buy out of the years grist of nearly  book titles   what to buy for adult and child readers  for lovers of fiction and nonfiction  for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified  when your budget is pitifully small   most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate  a startlingly high percentage do not exceed  annually  which includes the librarians salary  and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs  this in the worlds richest city  the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse  confronted with this situation  most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have  or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds  in some parts of the country  however  a cooperative movement has begun to grow  under the wing of state governments  whereby  with the financial help of the state  libraries share their book resources on a countywide or regional basis  new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these cooperative systems  so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow  because it is so large a state  with marked contrasts in population density  the organization of the new york cooperative offers a crosssection of how the plan works  at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state  where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large  sparsely populated area  at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system  in a highdensity area  with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve  both these types  and those in between  are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as   with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state  it was a step in the right direction  but it took an additional act passed in  to establish fully the thriving systems of today  under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts  an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not  as they saw fit  some library boards are wary of the plan  a large  wellstocked library  surrounded in a county by smaller ones  may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great  a small library may cherish its independence and established ways  and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board  within a system  however  the autonomy of each member library is preserved  the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program  facilities  and services  but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system  all services are given without cost to members  so obvious are these advantages that nearly  per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system  and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day  not too distant  when all the libraries in the state will belong to a coop  to set up a cooperative library system  the law requires a central book collection of  nonfiction volumes as the nucleus  and the system is organized around it  the collection may be in an existing library  or it may be built up in a central collection  each system develops differently  according to the area it serves  but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency  the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served  and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita  if a library spends a certain number of dollars  in nassau county  for example  the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city  the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons  a figure that has doubled since   this system  by virtue of its variety and size  offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation  the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service  what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge  and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area  the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries  adequate to satisfy everyday needs  could afford  nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters  which will reach its goal of  volumes by   the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building  and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers  basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection  but there is also specialization in science and technology  an indicated weakness in local libraries  on microfilm  headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in  to the present day  as well as bound volumes of important periodicals  the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans  headquarters gets about  requests every day  it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany  which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide  the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries  each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area  which headquarters could then build upon  east meadow has philosophy  psychology  and religion   freeport houses social science  pure science  and language   history  biography  and education are centered in hempstead   levittown has applied science  business  and literature   while hewlettwoodmere is the repository of art  music  and foreign languages  the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant  and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service  this kind of cooperation is not wholly new  of course  public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quartercentury  but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis  local libraries find  too  that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system  and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library  the system passes on these savings to its members  further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing  books are not the only resource of the system  schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary  art  and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs  and to organizations in member communities  the most recent film catalogue  available at each library  lists  titles presently in the collection  any of which may be borrowed without charge  this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children  young adults  or adults  although some classics cut across age groups  such as  nanook of the north    the emperors nightingale   and  the red balloon   workshops are conducted by the systems audiovisual consultant for the staffs of member libraries  teaching them the effective use of film as a library service  the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together   consequently an experienced childrens librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote wellplanned library activities  cooperating with the childrens librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences  workshops  and frequent visits  headquarters has also set up a central juvenile bookreview and bookselection center  to provide better methods of purchasing and selection  sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters  where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups  story hours  preschool programs  activities with community agencies  and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the childrens consultant  headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days  threatening to expand beyond its boundaries  in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the childrens program  headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county   it prepares cooperative displays  posters  booklists  brochures  and other promotional material  for use in member libraries   it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used   and it publishes sum and substance  a monthly newsletter  which reports the systems activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries  the system itself is governed by a board of trustees  geographically representing its membership  in nassau  as in other systems  the longrange objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools  and on adult education in general  librarians  a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication  can begin to see results today  library use is multiplying daily  and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans  the teenagers  to them especially the librarians  with the help of coops  hope they will never have to say   im sorry  we dont have that book   today  more than ever before  the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned  the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world  the need for lifetime reading is apparent  education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives  for it is only through knowledge that we  as a nation  can cope with the dangers that threaten our society  the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life  we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read   if we are not discriminating in our reading   if we do not know how to use what we do read  we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age  as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word  a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries  although progress has been made in americas system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america  the problem grows in intensity each year as mans knowledge  and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word  continue to expand  the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition  there are  for example  approximately  people in this country with no public library service and about  with inadequate service  in college libraries   per cent of the total number of books are owned by  of  institutions surveyed last year by the us office of education  and over  per cent of the elementary schools with  or more pupils do not have any library at all  in every aspect of service  to the public  to children in schools  to colleges and universities  the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services  only public understanding and support can provide that service  this is one of the main reasons for national library week  april   and for its theme   for a richer  fuller life  read    assembly session brought much good the general assembly  which adjourns today  has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened  it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools  an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education  there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight  in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers  the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need  longrange planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisistocrisis government  this session  for instance  may have insured a financial crisis two years from now  in all the turmoil  some good legislation was passed  some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action  certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law  the school bills  the increase in teacher pensions  the ban on drag racing  acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at

made georgia look like anything but  the empire state of the south   we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation  in the interim between now and next year  we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgias very real economic  fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics  league regularly stands on the side of right the league of women voters   now and admitting it proudly  is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive  its a good use of money  these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jeffersons dictum that one must cherish the peoples spirit but  keep alive their attention    if once they become inattentive to the

and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs  the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public  the harder the choice  the more willing the league is to wade in  and the league takes a stand  with great regularity  on the side of right  look to coosa valley for industrial progress cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the  northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission  coupling its own budget of  with a  state grant authorized by gov vandiver  the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech  then a fulltime planning office will be established in rome to work with a fivemember georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program  the undertaking has abundant promise  it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an areawide effort better results can be accomplished than through the goitalone approach  rusk idea strengthens united states defense the rusk belief in balanced defense  replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation  removes a grave danger that has existed  the danger lay not in believing that our own abombs would deter russias use of hers   that theory was and is sound  the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough  by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength  this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war  this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war  it also weakened our diplomatic stance  because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity  this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start lowgrade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity  by maintaining the nuclear deterrent  but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too  secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position  dekalb budget shows county is on beam dekalbs budget for  is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance  it includes a raise in the county minimum wage  creation of several new jobs at the executive level  financing of beefedup industrial development efforts  and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare  fire protection  sanitation and road maintenance  that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners  headed by chairman charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed  and other county officials  somewhere  somebody is bound to love us g mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly  touring africa  the new us assistant secretary of state observed  africa should be for the africans  and the

confidence in the states economic future is reflected in the georgia power companys record construction budget for this year  the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning  it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization  georgias mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a  budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital  actually it amounts to  above what the institution already is receiving  considering the additional halfmillion dollars gov vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus  either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is  but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing  the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished  the work week of attendants who are on duty  hours and more per week should be reduced  more attendants  nurses and doctors should be hired  patients deserve more attention than they are getting  even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year  georgia will be spending only around  per day per patient  the national average is more than  and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low  kansas  regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill  spends  per day per patient  georgia has made some reforms  true  the intensive treatment program is working well  but in so many other areas we still are dragging  considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done  it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted  the boost is helpful but inadequate  the end of trujillo assassination  even of a tyrant  is repulsive to men of good conscience  rafael trujillo  the often bloodthirsty dictator of the dominican republic for  years  perhaps deserved his fate in an evenhanded appraisal of history  but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered  trujillo knew a great deal about assassination  the responsibility for scores of deaths  including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez  a professor at columbia university in new york  has been laid at his door  he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela  it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government  reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez  has been uncovered and quashed  the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive  unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country  he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation  attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably  but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition  el benefactors vanity grew with his personal wealth  the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure  he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise  and his influence extended even to congress  until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo  and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character  tardily the government here came to understand how this countrys own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression  last year  after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean  the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him  thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines  trujillos dictatorship had been along conservative  rightwing lines  but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans  there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba  previously a bete noire to trujillo  thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces  what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle  the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation  and all alternative leadership has been suppressed  perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability  but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger  the dominican republic could turn toward communisttype authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom  such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people  who deserve to breathe without fear  for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help  start on rapid transit highspeed buses on the george washington memorial parkway  operating between downtown washington and cabin john  glen echo and brookmont  would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city  in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council  the administrator of the ncta  c darwin stolzenbach  was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching  such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area  because the buses would not stop on the parkway  land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed  the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress  must berlin remain divided   the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city  so far as the record is concerned  the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so  though walter ulbricht  by grace of soviet tanks  may be head man in east germany  that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semicity into the soviet zone  the wartime protocol of september     designated a special  greater berlin  area  comprising the entire city  to be under joint occupation  it was not a part of any one of the three  later four  zones for occupation by soviet  american  british  and french troops respectively  after the berlin blockade and airlift  the council of foreign ministers in  declared a purpose  to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin   for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas  then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany  that this and the closing of the east berlinwest berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain  france  and the united states sent to moscow after the latters gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin  the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin  and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile soundtruck taunts of gerhard eisler  the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities  to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany   they insisted on the  fundamental fact  that  the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status   this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact  there remains  of course  the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts  one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist  vopos  try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents  another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass  the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed  remembering the stepbystep fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about  salami  tactics  it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedys representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed  prairie national park thousands of buffalo   bison  they will never be to the man on the street  grazing like a mobile brown throwrug upon the rolling  dustygreen grassland  a horizon even and seamless  binding the vast sunbleached dome of sky to earth  that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in liveoak canyons near hollywood  for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill  the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county  northeast kansas  as a  prairie national park   there the buffalo would roam  to be seen as a tapestry  not as motheaten zoo specimens  wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved  grasslands would extend  unfenced  unplowed  unbroken by silo or barn  as the first settlers saw them  the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park  american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve  whisky on the air a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hardliquor advertising on tv and radio  starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters  the firm apparently is seeking to break down the antiliquor barriers in majormarket stations  probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power  the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hardliquor commercials  past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy  even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition  why  then  with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads  is it necessary to seek congressional action   simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread  soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of noncode competitors  although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudosophistication with which tv softdrinks are downed or toothpaste applied  there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsiecola and gulling him into downing bourbon  a law is needed  new york  democrats choice registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their partys candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization  in the central contest  that for mayor  they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other  mayor robert f wagner must  as his opponents demand  assume responsibility for his performance in office  while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools  law enforcement and fiscal policies  the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record  state controller arthur levitt  on the other hand  cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the citys welfare  they  too  have links with the citys ills  both men are known to be honest and publicspirited  mayor wagners shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post  as mayor  mr levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like  his election  on the other hand  would unquestionably strengthen the  regulars   mr wagner might or might not be a  new  mayor in this third term  now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls  bosses   these are  of course  the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote  but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him  if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish  it nevertheless must be made  the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party  little war  big test both mr ks have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos  president kennedy  already two quiet demands down  still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow  but at the same time he moved his helicopterborne marines to within an hour of the fighting  and secretary rusk  en route to bangkok  doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces  for mr kennedy  speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation  the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs  he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says  in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time  at his press conference mr kennedy said   all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn   at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position  since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington  this approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment  but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos  the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride  a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot  but would bog washington in a tactical mess  as wars go  laos is an extremely little one  casualties have been running about a dozen men a day  the hard core of the procommunist rebel force numbers only some  tough viet minh guerrilla fighters  but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough  less combattested government army in monsoonshrouded  roadshy  guerrillathwisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners  but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddockagainsttheindians contest  it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it  plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington  fortunately both the republicans and americas chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president  actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table  it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable  the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of   and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma  but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a proneutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a ceasefire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers  the road to a guaranteedneutral  coupproof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nations terrain  but for the safety of southeast asia  and for the sake of the laotian people  who would not be wellruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting  this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made  the world awaits mr khrushchevs choice of alternatives  a vote for educational tv the senates overwhelming    vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house  twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die  but this year prospects may be better  the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds  this years senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with  to be used in support of private  state  or municipal etv efforts  the funds would be used for equipment  not for land  buildings  or operation  the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value  but  lacking money from commercial sponsors  the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service  other communities  the ones to be aided most by the senate bill  have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment  a good man departs  goodby  mr sam  sam rayburn was a good man  a good american  and  third  a good democrat  he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure   mr speaker  mr sam  and mr democrat  at one and the same time  the house was his habitat and there he flourished  first as a young representative  then as a forceful committee chairman  and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth  speaker of the house  and second most powerful man in washington  mr rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label  he was no flaming liberal  yet the new deal  the fair deal and the new frontier needed him  he was not a rearlooking conservative  yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any  two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word  sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave  for he was never loquacious  and his word  once given  was not subject to retraction  it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs  the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical  his leadership was not for audiences  a growl  a nod  was usually enough  when it was not  one of the great dramas of washington would be presented  he would rise in the well of the house  his chin upon his chest  his hands gripping the side of a desk  and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence  he spoke briefly  sensibly  to the point and without oratorical flourishes  he made good  plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it  these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn normally did his counseling  persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor  he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them  with his long service he had a long memory  an excellent thing in a political leader  he was  of course  in the house for a very long time  there are only two men remaining in congress who  with rayburn  voted for the declaration of war against germany in   to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house  and it was the house he loved  to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition  the senate to him was not the  upper body  and he corrected those who said he served  under  the president  he served  with  him  sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death  woodrow wilson  with whom he began his years in washington  warren g harding  calvin coolidge  fdr  with whom he managed a social revolution  and those still with us  herbert c hoover  harry s truman  dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy  he was a fighter for those of his own party  mr truman has only to recall the  hopeless  campaign of  to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there  as it was  his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration  with republican presidents  he fought fair  he was his own man  not an automatic obstructionist  he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns  but that is part of the game he was born to play  under any name  mr speaker  mr democrat  mr sam  he was a good man  un off the congo track thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends  in  months  no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle  simply out of bloodlust  their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river  the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries  in other words  atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned  had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga  does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it   to the contrary  through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence  mass rapes  troop mutinies  uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures  given no sanction by any political authority  have become almost daily occurrences  yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga  it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government  which is itself a fiction  demonstrably incapable of governing  and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it  the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms   the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa  right now  they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga  that notion is fantastically wrongheaded from several points of view  the un army is too weak  too demoralized for the task  further  it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned  last  it makes no sense to deliver katanga  the one reasonably solid territory  into the existing chaos  the congo should have been mandated  because it was not ready for independence  the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom  it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism  but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly  it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach  otherwise  un will march blindly on to certain defeat  featherbed reversal a recent editorial discussing a labormanagement agreement reached between the southern pacific co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information  the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed  hours pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to  per cent per year  our comment was that this was  featherbedding  in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement  the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers  but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life  additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need  also  normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic  the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries  the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands  meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side  but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar  and when the lads met in st louis  it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful  despite an imperfection here and there  it was  the brief writers decided   mans best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world   peace  its wonderful  and  world law   its wonderful  too  and shouldnt we get an international covenant extending it into space  before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon   meanwhile  in moscow  khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to  million tons of tnt  to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who cant see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism  a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions  roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally  would certainly produce a bigger bang  and  just for kicks  khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st louis to the moon  where there wouldnt even be any beer to drink  while he was at it  the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who cant appreciate coexistence thru suicide   fools   he bayed   what do you think you are doing    the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we arent playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations  but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort  another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun  the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana  where  for some unknown reason  castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister  a passenger  who is not an admirer of old ten oclock shadow  the plane was sent back to the united states  for a change  but castro kept the crazy gunman  who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution  less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castros right hand man  che guevara  who edified the interamerican economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas  venezuela  the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen  who were on hand to promise latin americans a  billion dollar foreign aid millennium  perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes  but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that  but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests  these things would not happen  the same can be said about the halfhearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april  which  we trust  is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev  pass the iron rations  please  and light another candle  for its getting dark down here and were minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away  the customer loses again  the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain  as they had planned to do this month  the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway  which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional  smaller car  by reducing rates as much as  per cent  it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines  the boards action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws  a shock wave from africa word of dag hammarskjolds death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe  as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace  and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously  it was on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold war issues  his firm hand will be desperately missed  mr hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace  he had sought talks with moise tshombe  the secessionist president of congos katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody  he earnestly urged a ceasefire  the story of the fatal crash is not fully known  the unchartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired  whether this  or overt action  was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined  the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations most controversial leader  he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice  he courageously defended the rights of small nations  and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc  the congo  in whose cause he died  was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs  his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape  when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold  despite the danger  flew to exert a calming influence  he gave his life for his beliefs  the un session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing  it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments  if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice  that is the hope of mankind  monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miamis hardest tasks  too many have bogged down in bickering  even when public bodies arrived at a consensus  at least one dissenting vote has been usual  so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity  all nine members of the interamerican center authority voted for goodbody  companys proposal to finance the longawaited trade and cultural center  the widely known financial firm has  days to spell out the terms of its contract  if the indenture is accepted  the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue  then goodbody will hand over a minimum of  million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center  the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority  they allotted  three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged  less than half the sum has been spent  since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations  the balance is being budgeted for the coming year  unanimity on interama is not surprising  it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed  the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of  million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project  county officials have cooperated consistently  so have the peoples elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels  interama  as it rises  will be a living monument to greater miamis ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises  a short report and a good one progress  or lack of it  toward civil rights in the  states is reported in an impressive page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights  much happened in this field during the past  months  each state advisory committee documented its own activity  some accounts are quite lengthy but floridas is the shortest of all  requiring only four paragraphs   the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas   reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians  william d singer and john b turner of miami   no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year  either verbally or written  from any individual or group   the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights   problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint  the progress reported by the advisory committee is real  while some think we move too fast and others too slowly  floridas record is a good one and stands out among the   west germany remains western west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead  on berlin and unification  with a coalition government  this is the key fact emerging from sundays national election  chancellor adenauers christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since   in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength  inevitably this means some compromise  the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired  both willy brandts social democrats  who gained  seats in the new parliament  and the free democrats  who picked up   will insist on that before they enter the government  moonfaced ludwig erhart  the economic expert  probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him  if he becomes chancellor  dr erhart would make few changes  the wizard who fashioned west germanys astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise  he is dedicated to building the nations strength and  as are all west germans  to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany  what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result  if the party of adenauer and erhart  with  per cent of the vote  approaches the party of willy brandt  which won  per cent  the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve  west berlins mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it  the free democrats   per cent of the vote  believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union  and more dealings with the communist bloc  the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility  it could go either way  since the gains for both points of view were about the same  regardless of the decision two facts are clear  west germany  with its industrial and military might  reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations  and the career of konrad adenauer  who upheld germanys tradition of rocklike leaders which bismarck began  draws near the end  better ask before joining americans are a nation of joiners  a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing  but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesnt want to make a spectacle of himself  for instance  socalled  conservative  organizations  some of them secret  are sprouting in the garden of joining where  liberal  organizations once took root  one specific example is a secret  fraternity  which will  coordinate anticommunist efforts   the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled  according to the chicago tribune news service  state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name    does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations     does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges     does it put the label of unamerican or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically     does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars  communism  depression  and other troubles of the world     does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns     do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate   in some instances a seventh question can be added    does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government  political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system   if the wouldbe joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time  falling somewhere in a category between einsteins theory and sand fleas  difficult to see but undeniably there  nevertheless  is the tropical green  city  of islandia  a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents  limited access and an unlimited future  the latter is what concerns us all  whatever land you can see here  from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward  belongs to someone  people who have title to the land  and what you cant see  the land underneath the water  belongs to someone  too  the public  the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the abovewater land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment  in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida  the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours  in this instance  happily  insistence is being made that our share is protected  and until this protection is at least as concrete as  say  the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach  those who represent us all should agree to nothing  closed doors in city hall the reaction of certain city council members to californias newest antisecrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing  we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide  and  therefore  had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public  in the preamble to the openmeeting statutes  collectively known as the brown act  the legislature declares that  the public commissions  boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the peoples business  it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly   the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them  the people  in delegating authority  do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know  the full implementation of these noble words  however  has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature  since  california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted  but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act  despite the lip service paid by local governments  the antisecrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations  when all else fails  it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations  we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law  and one of its principal aims  without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily  but the citizens would  of course  never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious  help when needed if the dominican republic achieves free  democratic government  it will be due in large part to the us show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship  outwardly  ciudad trujillo is calm  none of the trujillo family remains  mr balaguer is in control  and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring  had us warships not appeared off the dominican coast  there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war  ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba  within the organization of american states  there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously  but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillos waterfront shouting   vive yankees    more  the us action was hailed by a principal opposition leader  dr juan bosch  as having saved  many lives and many troubles in the near future   mr balaguers troubles are by no means over  he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate  finally  the forces of authoritarianism  protrujillo and procastro alike  in cooperating toward that objective  oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states  matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in   now  as then  it is a matter of jobs  craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim  such as factory maintenance  the issue was sufficiently potent in  to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members  that breach was healed  years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations  or thats what it looked like at the time  but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs  walter reuther  leader of the industrial union faction of the aflcio  says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor  whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as  say  jimmy hoffa of the teamsters  is a matter of conjecture  but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craftindustrial rivalry do not win friends for labor  engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival  this country can have little patience with labors family feuds  the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded  and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world  labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive  deterrent the army  navy and air force  among others  may question secretary freemans claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the  strongest deterrent  to the spread of communism  but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the  greatest single source of strength  in the struggle to insure freedom around the world  mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by americas capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production  or even by the soviets successes in space  this shouldnt surprise the secretary   american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long  long time  in fact  over the years  the american farmers capacity to overproduce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar  and thus far  mr freeman has offered very little relief  the  feed grain program  which the secretary sponsored  has been declared a billion dollar fiasco  in exchange for higher price supports  growers pledged reduction in planted acreage  but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer  the result   billion added to the deficit in the federal budget  perhaps  as mr freeman says  american agriculture may stop the communists  but it is also swindling the american taxpayer  whats wrong at state a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions  the department needs a clearer  sense of direction  at the top and it needs fewer  but better  people  sen jackson says  the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department  president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance  but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must  first of all  overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures  suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes  nor does sen jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy  this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates  but competent observers believe he is making progress  particularly toward what sen jackson lists as the primary need   a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them   the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged  as sen jackson puts it   in work that does not really need doing   mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jacksons recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved  selfcriticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress  betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist  but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends  james p mitchell  when he was the head of the department  promised to eat his hat if unemployment didnt drop below three million a couple of years ago  he lost  but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora  his successor  secretary goldberg  also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under  per cent for the last  months  no betting man  mr goldberg says hes merely  putting my neck out again  by predicting the rate will go down this month  he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride  a new record high in personal income  an increase in housing starts  a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods  mr mitchell had an excuse for losing  the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated  mr goldberg has less reason for missing  the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the  hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they cant be blamed in november  the odds thus appear favorable that the secretarys neck may be spared  little resistance cambodias chief of state  who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand  insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia  but so convinced of communisms inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel   i have to see the facts   is the way the prince puts it  and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a prowestern posture  prince sihanouks powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions  bottom sighted commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washingtons economic forecasters  weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement  recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges appraisal  though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house  and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point  he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump  the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales  februarys volume was  per cent above januarys for the first pickup since last october  although its still  per cent off from february   corroborating mr hodges figures was the federal reserve boards report of the large sales increase in the nations department stores for the week ending march   in newark  for example  this gain was put at  per cent above the yearearlier level  of course  some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in   another optimistic sign  this one from the labor department  was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments  was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb    initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by  in the week ending march   mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesnt think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes  well  we cant have everything  prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut  in new jersey  too new jersey folk need not be told of the builders march to the sea  for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain  now the stone harbor bird sanctuary   acres of magic attraction for exotic herons  is threatened  but the battlefront extends far beyond our state  against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of  miles of cape cod shoreline  the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant  but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves  the move for establishment of a national seashore park on  acres of cape cod  from provincetown to chatham  is strengthened by president kennedys interest in that area  but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern  for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country  by comparison  stone harbor bird sanctuarys allies seem less formidable  for aside from the audubon society  they are mostly the snowy  common and cattle egrets and the louisiana  green  little blue and blackcrowned herons who nest and feed there  but there is hope  for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space  the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year  public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing  but that heritage is shrinking even faster  no joyride much of the glamor president kennedys peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver  the head corpsman  anybody who is expecting a joyride should  according to mr shriver  get off the train right now  first of all  the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling  it will be a hour training day  then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet  culture  language and living conditions will be different  and the pay  of course  will be nil  despite all this  the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else  the study of the st louis areas economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey of  and the easily observed picture of the missouriillinois countryside  st louis sits in the center of a relatively slowgrowing and in some places stagnant midcontinent region  slackened regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the regions relative lack of purchasing power  not all st louis industries  of course  have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood  but for those which do  the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core  the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois  gov daltons new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a ninestate regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry  that is one approach  another would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis  president of the university of missouri  and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouris economy  he says the state  in order to proceed with economic development  must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy  the research center of the universitys school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr ellis has been talking about  he and dean john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference  the university can make a valuable contribution to the states economic development through such a study  in southern illinois  the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth  the carbondale industrial development corp has obtained a  loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a cityowned factory to accommodate production that will provide  new jobs  carbondale is in the herrinmurphysborowest frankfort labor market  where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average  the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouris depressed areas  and in the long run that will benefit st louis as well  politicsridden st clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development  more industrial acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st louis area  the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side  and then there is st louis county  where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning  of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth  st louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform  and permitted parochial interests to take priority over areawide interests  some plantlocation specialists take these signs to mean st louis county doesnt want industry  and so they avoid the area  and more jobs are lost  metropolitan st louiss relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political  business  civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi  without a great acceleration in the metropolitan areas economy  there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters  and st louis will slip into secondclass status  an excess of zeal many of our very best friends are reformers  still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far  take  for example  the reformers among new york citys democrats  having whipped mr de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall  they have changed the name to chatham hall  even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building  do they believe that they can make the new name stick   granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame  the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit  but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name  after all  it goes back to the days in which sedition was not unamerican  the days in which the sons of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence  the british government  that is  further  do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo   they will  when they give up the donkey and the elephant  instead of attempting the impossible  why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tigers stripes are not black   that might go over  the faget case the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official  col mariano faget  from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service  the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds  the kennedy administration had assured anticastro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista  using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro  moreover  col fagets information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in  screening  castro agents   the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power  and while he had headed batistas anticommunist section  the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists  responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing  an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service  gen swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office  his official term expired last summer  some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend  congressman walter of pennsylvania  at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get  congressman walter has been allpowerful in immigration matters  but he has announced plans to retire in   at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen swing  the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat  mr eisenhower  politician as president  dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics  as a former president  however  mr eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally  and generally missed his target  mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a  juvenile experiment  and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon  this was juvenile ridicule  nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad  his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding  the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of  dollarette  dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies  it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit  finally  mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington  this statement recalls the  berlin crisis  when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too  the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded  expresidents  relieved of accountability for policy  sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words  some of former president trumans offthecuff discourses have been in that vein  nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics  but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility  this is a matter of respect for the presidency  mr eisenhowers new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship  queen of the seas the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed  luxury  and impeccable british service on the high seas  reports that the venerable liner  which has been in service since   was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us  but the cunard line  influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment  has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least  a new queen  with the prosaic title of q  had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary  the british government  concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry  had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling  toward the  cost of a new ton passenger liner  since   more and more transatlantic passengers have been crossing by air  economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines  competition from other steamship lines has cut cunards share of sea passengers from onethird to onefourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run  the cunard line has under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than  tons  this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months  also under consideration is an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to serve new york  the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation  mission to viet nam gen maxwell taylors statement in saigon that he is  very much encouraged  about the chances of the prowestern government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to bolster the vietnamese army  gen taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and  judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east  he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military  economic  political and other resources  there was good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time  communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a new crisis  south viet nams rice surplus for next year  more than  tons  may have been destroyed  the viet cong  the communist rebels  may have lost their stored grain and arms factories  the rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in november  nothing that is likely to happen  however  should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions  the indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in   when gen ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of  to  divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing  it is a war to stay out of today  especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently does not want united states troops  he may want additional technical help  and this should be forthcoming  south viet nam has received  in united states aid since  and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnsons visit last may  gen taylor  the presidents special military adviser  is a levelheaded officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure  it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable  and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an asian morass  gov john m dalton  himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government  spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly  or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained  not because of their legal talents  but because of their government influence  the uns  gravest crisis  ambassador stevenson yesterday described the uns problem of electing a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold as  the gravest crisis the institution has faced   of course it is  if the decision goes wrong  it may be  as mr stevenson fears   the first step on the slippery path downhill  to a un without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning  the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be  as the charter puts it   the chief administrative officer of the organization   but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority  external to the organization   in other words  the secretary general is to be a nonpartisan  international servant  not a political  national one  he should be  as dag hammarskjold certainly was  a citizen of the world  the charter does stipulate that  due regard  shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on  as wide a geographical basis as possible   the united states and its allies have had no objection to this  what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjolds death to turn the entire un staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come  the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary general and  more particularly  around the nature of his relationship with them  although the united states and the ussr have been arguing whether there shall be four  five or six top assistants  the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work  if any one of them has any power to veto the secretary generals decisions the nature of the organization will have changed  if they give him advice when he asks it  or if they perform specified duties under his direction  the nature of the u n will not of necessity change  the secretary general must have  subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly  the power to act  to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone elses instructions  this is the root issue for which the united states should stand  we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography  what we must have  if the united nations is to survive  is as nonpolitical  nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it  subject to no single nations direction and subservient to no single nations ambition  what the new charter does the new city charter  which should get a yes vote as question no  on nov   would not make a good mayor out of a bad one  there is no such magic in manmade laws  but it would greatly strengthen any mayors executive powers  remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the board of estimate  increase his budgetmaking authority both as to expense and capital budgets  and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy  lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor  thus there is a clearer division of authority  administrative and legislative  the board is diminished in both respects  while it retains control over zoning  franchises  pier leases  sale  leasing and assignment of property  and other trusteeship functions  the board will be able to increase  decrease  add or eliminate budget items  subject to the mayors veto   but the city council will now share fully this budgetaltering power  overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council  and a twothirds vote  the controller retains his essential  fiscal watchdog  functions   his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed  he loses nowmisplaced tax collection duties  which go to the finance department  on net balance  in spite of controller gerosas opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office  the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now  borough presidents  while retaining membership in the board of estimate  lose their housekeeping functions  highways go to a new department of highways  sewers to the department of public works  such street cleaning as borough presidents now do  in queens and richmond  to the sanitation department  some fiscal changes are important  the expense  operating  budget is to be a program budget  and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy  with the mayor approving  in fund transfers within a department  the capital budget  for construction of permanent improvements  becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises   but  as a secondlook safeguard  each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds  a road block to desirable local or borough improvements  heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress  is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected  this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business   it will also correct some injustices  enlargement of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow  interamerican press the interamerican press association  which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn  is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years  the i a p a is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere   and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution  as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime  more and more cuban publishers  editors and correspondents were forced into exile  the i a p a found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before batistas dictatorship began in   freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances  in such conditions all freedoms are lost  this  in more diplomatic language  is what adlai stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government  he felt able to end on a note of hope  he sees evidence of fair winds for the tenyear alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms  no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the interamerican press association  meeting in moscow the twentysecond soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced  according to the original program  premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage  depending upon individual or national politics  because of the  bold program for building communism in our time  which the congress will adopt  but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by   the world is watching moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future  the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russias progress painted by the communist partys program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier khrushchevs berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered  whether it is or not  the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated  and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for  they and their children must first survive  this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years  the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress  and the central committee it will elect  will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening  both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job  dr conants call to action dr james b conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer  his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change  now  a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities  including new york  has shattered this optimism  dr conant has come away shocked and angry  his new book  entitled  slums and suburbs   calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster  there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr conants specific views  his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood  in the interest of integration  will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for  and achieved  this open or permissive enrollment  dr conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality  his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical  law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves  even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend  but these are side issues to a powerful central theme  that theme cuts through hypocrisies  complacency and doubletalk  it labels the slums  especially the negro slums  as deadend streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters  the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters  and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike  the facts  he adds  are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools  regardless of the color of their students  a call for action  before it is too late  has alarming implications when it comes from a man who  in his previous reports on the schools  cautioned so strongly against extreme measures  these warnings must not be treated lightly  dr conants conscientious  selfless efforts deserve the nations gratitude  he has served in positions of greater glamour  both at home and abroad   but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools  and now  more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive socalled junk mail  he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps  names  addresses or even zone numbers  in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress  each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters  speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district  this means an added burden to innumerable postmen  who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay  and it presumably means an increased postal deficit  but  our correspondent writes  think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis  our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art  occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another  but these are mostly typewritten  most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter  old  tired  trembling the woman came to the cannery  she had  she said  heard that the plant was closing  it couldnt close  she said  she had raised a calf  grown it beeffat  she had  with her own workweary hands  put seeds in the ground  watched them sprout  bud  blossom  and get ready to bear  she was ready to kill the beef  dress it out  and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup  broth  hash  and stew against the winter  she had done it last year  and the year before  and the year before that  and she  and her people were dependent upon these cans for food  this did not happen in counties of north georgia  where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land  nor in south georgia  where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields  this happened in decatur  dekalb county  not  miles from the heart of metropolitian atlanta  and now  the woman  tired and trembling  came here to the dekalb county cannery   is it so the cannery is going to close    o n moss    tall  grey as a possum  canning plant chief since   didnt know what to say  he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer  he did say he was out of cans  the no s  but  i requisitioned    he said he had no s enough to last two weeks more  threat of closing the cannery is a recent one  a threeman committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed  reason  the cannery loses  yearly  but dekalb citizens  those who use the facilities of the cannery  say the cannery is not supposed to make any money   the cannery   said mrs lewellyn lundeen  an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of   to handle the  victory garden  produce   is a service to the taxpayer  and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat  to plant  grow vegetables and put them up  it helps those people who help themselves   the county  though  seems more interested in those people who dont even try  those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food   a driver of a dairy truck  who begins work at  am finishes before breakfast  then goes out and grows a garden  and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five  asked   what in the world will we do     what in the world   echoed others  those come with the beans  potatoes  the tomatoes   will any of us do    moss  a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county  doesnt believe it will close  but he is in the middle  an employe of dekalb  but on the side of the people  the young married people   the old couples  the dairy truck driver   the old woman with the stew   dont ask me if i think the cannery helps   he said   sir  i know the cannery helps   most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard  when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say   just forget it   there is one thing i know   a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge  i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades  several years ago i was his pastor  one night  at the close of the evening service  he came forward  left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to god  after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land   we tried to settle this dispute   he said   but could never come to an agreement  i settled it tonight   he continued   i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart  i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor   forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god  you cannot wear the banner of god and at the same time harbor envy  jealousy and grudges in your heart  henry van dyke said   forgive and forget if you can   but forgive anyway   jesus made three things clear about forgiveness  we must  first of all  be willing to forgive others before we can secure gods forgiveness   for if ye forgive men their trespasses  your heavenly father will also forgive you  but if ye forgive not men their trespasses  neither will your father forgive  your trespasses   matthew     it will do no good to seek gods forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong  then  jesus indicated that gods forgiveness is unlimited  in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words   forgive us our debts   when a person meets gods requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven  gods mercy and patience will last forever  forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by gods love  it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past  we want the past forgiven  but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future  finally  we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us  once peter asked   how oft shall my brother sin against me  and i forgive him   till seven times   jesus saith unto him  until seventy times seven   matthew     jesus not only taught forgiveness  he gave us an example of it on the cross  with all the energy of his broken body he prayed   father  forgive them  for they know not what they do   luke   shes been in and out of my house for a dozen years now  although shes still a teenager who looks like a baby  she is getting married  her mother  now dead  was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her  something her mother would wish said  for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldnt have made myself heard if id had the equivalent of the message to garcia  but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female  six girls sprawled on one bed  drinking cokes and giggling  she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute   how do you know you love somebody enough to get married    she asked  it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked  how can you be sure    arent you sure    i asked  looking at her searchingly  i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait  to consider  to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important  but if she were just having a normal case of prenuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage  besides  in all honesty  i dont know how you can be sure  i dont know any secret recipe for certainty  in the fevered  intoxicating  breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured  i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth   does he ever bore you    i asked   bore me    she was shocked  oh  noo   why  hes so darling and   i mean   i went on ruthlessly   when hes not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love  is he interesting   does he care about things that matter to you   can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating   because  honey  i thought silently  there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage  long periods when youre hopelessly stranded  together  and if you bore each other then  heaven help you  she came back the other day to reassure me  she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting  she asked if i had other advice and  heady with success  i rushed it in  i hope not too late  be friends with your motherinlaw  jokes  cartoons and cynics to the contrary  mothersinlaw make good friends  i do not know dr wilson sneed well  but i was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st lukes church in atlanta  it was the cry of not just one heart   it spoke for many in the clergy  i suspect  the pulpit is a lonely place  who stops to think of that   imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church   such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments   he told his members  a minister should not stay  beyond the time that his leadership should benefit  his church  he wrote   for he becomes ordinary   and so the young minister resigned  to go and study and pray  having never passed a day  he told his parishioners  when  i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you   his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister  a modest methodist  who said   i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men  and i would have it no other way  and it is unworthy to think of self  but oh  how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest  and peace  in myself   a man who gives himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving  he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach  the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly  nor are they disposed to covet comfort  or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity  theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards  yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him  we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due  we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul  we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word  and gods  we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty  but we add to their burden  while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week  american cash  if we break the minister to our bit  we are buying back our own sins  if he wont break  we add to the stress he bears  and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man  prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to  we expect him to be noble  and to make us so  yet he knows  and tries to tell us  how very humble man must be  we expect bestowal of gods love through him  but how little love we give him  the church truly is not a rest home for saints  but a hospital for sinners  yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid  and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers  too  mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake  the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure  the evening was not always spent in the same way  this year  on a night cool with the front of september moving in  but with plenty of summer still about  the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod  the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages  in the midst of it all  mr podger came out on the pod porch  alone  he had that day attended a country auction  and he had come back with a prize  the prize was an oldfashioned  woven cloth hammock  complete with crosstop pillow  fringed side pieces  and hooks for hanging  mrs podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it  and there it was  slung in a vineshaded corner  the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow  caressing movement  mr podger sat down in it  pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow  rhythmic motions  and then swung his feet up into it  he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him  suddenly one young voice rose above the others   but   it said   do you always know when youre happy    the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound  but the question stayed in mr podgers mind  here  in the cool  autumntouched evening  mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace  it had begun with the blue jay feather  walking along the lake before breakfast  mr podger had seen the feather  and the bird that had lost it in flight  the winging spread of blue had gone on  calling harshly  into the wood  the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet  all day long mr podger  who was a strawhat man in the summer  had worn the feather in the band of his broadbrimmed sunshield  would a blue feather in a mans hat make him happy all day   hardly  but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine  linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake  then  since the auction was being held nearby  he had walked to it  and there  on the way  had been the box turtle  that slow  selfcontained  worldignoring relic of prehistory  bent  for reasons best known to itself  on crossing the road  it was doing very well  too  having reached the center  and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car  would the driver see the turtle   would he take pains to avoid it   mr podger took no chances  taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it  mr podger stepped into the road  lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its roadcrossing with what must have been a breathtaking suddenness  the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon  but mr podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other  here in the cool darkness mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday  could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road  could still see the friendly grin on the young  sunbrowned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight  where was the driver now   what was he doing   and the turtle   mr podger smiled  for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama  the three would never meet again  but for some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember the incident  then there had been the auction itself  mr podger heard again   at will  the voice of the auctioneer  the voices of the bidders  and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr podgers hammock purchase   i like them things  too   he had said   we got one at home  you know what   if youre lyin out in the hammock at night  and it gets kinda cool  you know  you just take these sides with the fringe on  see  and wrap em right over you  i do it  lots o times  i like to lie in a hammock at night  by myself  when its all quiet  the wind moves it a little bit  you know   mr podger had thanked him gravely  and now he made use of the advice  as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon  mr podger saw that thin  attractive  freckled little face again  and hoped that the boy  too  was lying in a cool  fringedwrapped quiet  alacrity  the podger cat  came by the hammock  rubbed her back briefly against it  and then  sure of a welcome  hopped up  she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly  and mr podger took her inside the fringe  soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets  rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod  mr podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and pam burst out   dad    she said   its getting so chilly weve lighted a fire  and were going to tell a round robin story  a nice  scary one  we need you to start it  why are you out here all by yourself   arent you happy    mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged  tucking alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire   of course i am   he said   never happier in my life  i just came out here to know it   dallas as the south begins another school year  national and even world attention is directed at the regions slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools  desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities  dallas and atlanta  in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment  these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully  the programs do not take sides on the issue itself  they point out simply that  it is the law of the land   the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation  even better  they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs  in each case there was an initial act of violence  in nashville  a school was dynamited  in houston  there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes  none of which were serious  in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents  the nashville plan  incidentally  has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south  it is a  stairstep  plan  in which desegregation begins in the first grade  each year another grade is added to the process  until finally all  grades are integrated  the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done   so why not now   the program has worked well in both nashville and houston  it met a serious rebuff in new orleans  where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents  another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program  generally  throughout the south  there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met  perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas  during the summer  negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments  it was part of a citywide move toward full integration  so successful has been this program  worked out by white and negro civic leaders  that further extensions are expected in the next few months  hotels  for example  are ready to let down the bars  already  at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis  several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis  this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago  when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously allwhite neighborhoods of dallas  it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south  southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights  they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots  all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it  there are many causes for this change  one of the most important is economic  business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence  they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order  in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way  and as the businessmen have begun to act  a real sense of cooperation has sprung up  this cooperation has emboldened other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation  they realize that by acting in concert  rather than individually  they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation  economic and otherwise  since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago  ive been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship  played mostly on the freeways around los angeles  it goes like this  a driver cruising easily at  mph in lane a of a fourlane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead  traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into lane b  which is heavily populated by cars also moving at  mph  the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him  he can    point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a      slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes   or    alternately accelerate and decelerate  thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions  thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair  the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access  whether or not this is done out of enlightened selfpreservation  i dont know  but it is done  consistently and im both surprised and impressed  this could never happen in my native chicago  there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood  in chicago  the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back  failing this  he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly  this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways  however  does an injustice to southern california drivers  at the risk of losing my chargeaplate at marshall field and company  i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype  after three months of research  i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers ive ever encountered  during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street  miami  fla  march   an outoftown writer came up to paul richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year  now richards  of course  is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go  he can often make the complex ridiculously simple  and vice versa  this happened to be vice versa  but even so  the answer was a masterpiece   its a whole lot easier   he said   to increase the population of nevada  than it is to increase the population of new york city   and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher   that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote   said the writer  scratching his head   now  if i can just figure out what hes talking about  ill use it   two spots open this was just richards way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open  some brilliant rookies nailed them down  so that this spring just two spots  left and right field  are really up for grabs  it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year  but so far it hasnt worked that way  this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one  youd never guess it from the way theyve played so far this spring  but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in   obviously  if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league  it will have to show improvement someplace  where can that improvement possibly come from   you certainly cant expect the infield to do any better than it did last year  robby could be better  brooks robinson is great  and it is conceivable that hell do even better in  than he did in   you cant expect it  though  robbys performance last year was tremendous  its the same with ron hansen and jim gentile  if they do as well as they did in  there can be no complaint  they shouldnt be asked to carry any more of the burden  hansen will be getting a late spring training start  which might very well set him back  he got off to an exceptional start last season  and under the circumstances probably wont duplicate it  there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year  they dont expect to stop him  just slow him down some with the bat  hell still be a top player  they concede  because hes got a great glove and the long ball going for him  but they expect to reduce his overall offensive production  breeding might move up  gentile can hardly do better than drive in  runs  dont ask him more  i have a hunch marv breeding might move up a notch  but even so  he had a good year in  and wont do too much better  so  all in all  the infield cant be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second to first  and the pitching will also have trouble doing better  richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season  where  then  can we look for improvement    from triandos  brandt and walker   answers richards   theyre the ones we can expect to do better   the man is right  and at this time  indications are that these three are ready for better seasons  triandos hasnt proved it yet  but he says hes convinced his thumb is all right  he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it  but he says the old injury hasnt bothered him  if he can bounce back with one of those  home runs years  the club will have to be better off offensively  im still not convinced  though  ill have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him  hank foiles  backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the minors  make up better second line catching than the birds had all last year  but gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant  to me  brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year  he hasnt played too much  because richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice  hes hitting the ball hard  in the batting cage  and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year  when he came to baltimore  he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league pennant  and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club  he was down  hard to talk to  and far too nonchalant on the field  as of now  that all seems behind him  hes been entirely different all spring  and walker looks stronger  seems to be throwing better than he did last year  let him bounce back  and he could really set up the staff  so  if the orioles are to improve  brandt  triandos and walker will have to do it  so far the platoons on left and right fielders dont seem capable of carrying the load  of course  this isnt taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york city  but its the way things look from here at this point  is the mother of an  autistic  child at fault    the  autistic  child is one who seems to lack a welldefined sense of self  he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects  and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people   did his mother make him this way   some people believe she did  we think differently  we believe that autism  like so many other conditions of defect and deviation  is to a large extent inborn  a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties  sometimes she can  to a large extent  help him overcome them  but we dont think she creates them  we dont think she can make her child defective  emotionally disturbed or autistic  the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often  by sharing her experiences  she can help other mothers with the same problem  since little is known about autism  and almost nothing has been written for the layman  wed like to share one experienced mothers comments  she wrote  total disinterest   as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything  i have to manipulate my sons fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy  he wants me to do everything for him   you dont believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them  but i do and my psychiatrist does  too  i know  that my son wants control and direction  but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction   one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned  this is that autistic people dont enjoy physical contact with others  for instance  my children and i  when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board  he pushes and straightens himself as if he cant stand the feeling of being held  physical contact is uncomfortable for him    this mother is quite correct  as a rule  the autistic child doesnt enjoy physical contact with others  parents have to find other ways of comforting him  for the young child this may be no more than providing food  light or movement  as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object  his  magic  thing   or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick  the answer is different for each autistic child  but for most there is an answer  only ingenuity will uncover it  what future holds  dear doctors  we learned this year that our older son  daniel  is autistic  we did not accept the diagnosis at once  but gradually we are coming to  fortunately  there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend  with a group of normal children   i try to treat daniel as if he were normal  though of course i realize he is far from that at present  what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible  i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible   what is your experience with autistic children   how do they turn out later    many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives  certainly  most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people  but many adjust to school  even college  to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood  singlecolor use question  a first grader colors pictures one solid color  everything  sky  grass  boy  wagon  etc  when different colors are used  she is just as likely to color trees purple  hair green  etc  the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color  should i show my daughter how things should be colored   she is an aggressive  nervous child  is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits   answer  her choice of one color

responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms  which seems slated to replace the onecolor look to which we have been accustomed  just as a varitinted oriental rug may

yearold amateur politico  thomas b carvey jr  whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircrafts moon missiles  hes approached his democratic duties in hardnosed engineering fashion  viewed from afar  the cdc looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid  its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees  and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups   or so  much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every  volunteer  democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the aj  moreover  the entire state democratic hierarchy  from gov brown on down to the county chairmen  also participates in this huge operation  contrarily  republican  volunteers  go their separate ways  and thus far have given no indication that theyd be willing to join forces under a single directorate  except in the most looseknit fashion  carvey believes that reapportionment  which left many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries  actually will increase cdc membership  where only one club existed before  he says  two will flourish henceforth  biggest organizational problem  he adds  is setting up cdc units in rockribbed democratic territory  paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register  and to in the partys favor  strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis  like most democratic spokesmen  carvey predicts  will be a tremendously  partisan year   hence the attention theyre lavishing on the aj  in all probability  the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress  and then strive to put its full weight behind these preprimary favorites  this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been

accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty  president kennedys latest warning to the communist world that the united states will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was  somewhat surprisingly  reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron curtain  then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency  now listen closely  moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england   president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals  to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat  as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism  evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the west have been planned long in advance  the west berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the united states to justify its arms drive   the soviet news agency tass

president kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the united states  in fact  the world heard nothing but sabrerattling  the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current president  if there were no west berlin problem  imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the united states and its nato partners  washington apparently decided to use an old formula  by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the us economy after a prolonged slump   and now  for communist listeners and readers  moscow radio in russian to the ussr   the us president has shown once again that the united states needs the

military adventures   east berlin  communist  radio in german to germany   a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech  kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west berlin  neither conventional nor nuclear  and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty  whenever some washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn  in kennedys speech are cross currents  sensible ones and senseless ones  reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the presidents advisers and the political and economic forces behind them  well  dear listeners  despite all the shouting  there will be no war over west berlin   moscow tass in russian datelined sochi   chairman khrushchev received the us presidents disarmament adviser  john mccloy  their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere   now  to translate from the communese  this

khrushchev  kennedy  rattles his rockets  sabre  in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position  his advisers in the politburo  white house  are engaged in a great struggle of opinions  so he is not always consistent  the soviet union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over berlin  and neither will its warsaw pact allies  the west has no intention of attacking russia  chairman khrushchev and john mccloy had a terrible row at sochi  see  communese is easy  once you get onto it  aug     nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded

simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament  the first part of the new english bible  undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english  since it was issued in the spring of   the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible  however  biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies  as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced  this resulted in revisions of the king james bible in  as the english revised version and in  as the american standard version  then in  americas international council of religious education authorized a new revision  in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages  undertaken by  american scholars  under the chairmanship of rev dr luther a weigle  former dean of yale university divinity school  their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version    not rival the new english bible  the old testament and apocrypha will be published at a future date  has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version  but  as its cover states  it is offered  simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading  teaching  or worship   time  of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose  bible reading  even more so than good classical music  grows in depth and meaning upon repetition  if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years  it will not survive the ages as has the king james version  however  an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars  one is impressed with the dignity  clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english  and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king james  for example  in the third chapter of matthew  verses   describing the baptism of jesus  the  version reads   then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john  to be baptized of him   but john forbad him  saying  i have need to be baptized of thee  and comest thou to me    and jesus answering said unto him  suffer it to be so now  for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness  then he suffered him   and jesus  when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water  and lo  the heavens were opened unto him  and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove  and lighting upon him   clearer meaning certainly  the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical teachings  in the new english bible which reads   then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee  and he came to john to be baptized by him  john tried to dissuade him   do you come to me    he said    i need rather to be baptized by you  jesus replied   let it be so for the present   we do well to conform this way with all that god requires  john then allowed him to come  after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once  and at that moment heaven opened   he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove to alight upon him     the paragraphing  spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version   among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes and yet so few persons  other than scholars  really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount  to illustrate  the first blessing in the king james bible reads   blessed are the poor in spirit   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven   the new version states   how blest are those who know that they are poor   the kingdom of heaven is theirs   some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one  but almost anyone  with a fair knowledge of the english language  can understand the meaning  without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar  to a novice that is significant  in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retains  however  the old phrase  angel of the church  which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop  this is not contemporary english  mostly contemporary for the most part  however  the new version is contemporary and  as such  should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ  originally recorded by hand  these words have been copied and recopied  translated and retranslated through the ages  discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings  some by the early church fathers  in themselves called for a restudy of the bible  to have the results recorded in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth  there is one danger  however  with contemporary english changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age  some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic  the only answer will be continuous study  the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england  church of scotland  methodist church  congregational union  baptist union  presbyterian church of

dentists recommend  in addition  it is small enough to get into crevices  jacket and crown margins  malposed anteriors  and the back teeth  the bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel  it is conceivable that broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing  especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly  several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device  the results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing  particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly  the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly  bedfast with a chronic disease  or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral

leggett  bankereditor of the phoenix  arizona progress   reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties  one of the roughest was the tv quiz shows  which gave him inferiority complexes  though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies  it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent  wellinformed american  but the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a  profit on the stock market  every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb  investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough  people who take us for suckers are like the westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bullseye achievements  the promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it  his answer was simple but honest  he just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bullseye  one of the obstacles to the easy control of a yearold child is a lack of verbal communication  the child understands no  he senses his mothers disapproval  but explanations leave him confused and unmoved  if his mother loves him  he clings to that love as a ballast  it motivates his behavior  he wants mommy to think him a good boy  he doesnt want her to look frowningly at him  or speak to him angrily  this breaks his heart  he wants to be called sweet  good  considerate and mothers little helper  but even mothers loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior  his desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mothers love for him and what she expects of him  in order to overcome them  his own inner voice  which should tell him what not to do  has not developed  it wont develop until he has words with which to clothe it  the conscience is nonexistent in the yearold  what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior   she can decrease the number of temptations  she can remove all knickknacks within reach  the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be  she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child  if he cant play with mommys magazines  he should have some old numbers of his own  if daddys books are out of bounds his own picture books are not  toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove  during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the childs conscience  she tells him of the consequences of his behavior  if he bites a playmate she says   danny wont like you   if he snatches a toy  she says   caroline wants her own truck just as you do   there is no use trying to  explain  to a yearold  actions speak louder  remove temptations  remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior  substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act  he wont submit to his natural desires all the time  and its mothers love that is responsible for his good behavior  this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call  homecoming day   they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes  the football opponent on homecoming is  of course  selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the emperors lions  it is true  of course  the uncertainties of life being what they are  that as now and then the christian killed the lion  homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team  even with all possible precaution  homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad  and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them  more often than not  as the old grad wanders along the old paths  his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain  he can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter  and can smell again the aroma of autumn  fallen leaves  the wine of cool air  and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall  undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates  faces alight  holding hands and talking happily as they come along  oblivious of him  or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances  such as they would give a tethered goat  usually  they titter loudly after they have passed by  his dream goes  he feels  suddenly  the weight of the fat that is on him  his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous  his bifocals blur  his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary  as if he had walked for miles  instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths  bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth  it is not much better if he meets with old classmates  too often  unless he hails them  they pass him by  he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said  on returning from a homecoming reunion  that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didnt even recognize him  if they do meet and recognize one another  slap backs and embrace  the moment soon is done  after all  when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children  and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it  middleaged spread by then one begins to notice the middleage spread   the gray hairs  the eyeglasses  bodies that are too thin or too heavy   the fading signs of old beauty   the athlete of bygone years who wears a size  suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then  it is time to break it up and move on  it is  if anything  worse on the old player he sits in the stands and he doesnt like that  enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd  he always feels lonely  a team feels something  on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him  in the stands he is lonely and lost  no matter how many are about him  he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped   the churning of straining feet  the rasp of the canvas pants   the smell and feel of hot  wet woolen sleeves across his face  he remembers the desperate  panting breath   the long runs on the kickoffs   the hard  jolting tackles   the breakthrough   the desperate agony of goalline stands  and so  he squirms with each play  remembering his youth  but it is no use  it is gone  no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength  they can never be recaptured again  since the obvious is not always true  the republican national committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred  as suspected  in the larger cities  of  cities with populations of  and more  mr kennedy carried  and mr nixon   there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election  these are new york  pennsylvania  michigan  maryland  missouri  new jersey  illinois and minnesota  in  mr eisenhower won all but missouri  yet  in  all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy  republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia  mr nixon  despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups  failed to do so  his visit to warsaw  poland  after the russian journey in the summer of  was expected to win the polish vote which  in several cities  is substantial  yet  the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr nixon received but  per cent of the socalled  polish  vote    per cent of the  irish  vote  and  per cent of the  negro  vote   task force  a gop  task force  committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities  the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders  these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment  this error was compounded by declaring the recession to be  a statistical one   and not a reality  the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working parttime do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical  they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor goldberg as politics  which the gop declared it to be  the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery  senator mundts gross distortion of president eisenhowers conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy as too left wing  a statement mr eisenhower declared to be entirely false  is another case in point  if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program  they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities  errors repeated the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt  goldwater  bridges  dirksen  et al  is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the s  in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr hoover  and the partys failure to anticipate or cope with the depression  caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash  the republican party was not lacking in humanity  but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble  farmers called their muledrawn pickup trucks  hoover carts   smokers reduced to  the makings   spoke of the sack tobacco as  hoover dust   one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasnt meant to repeat this error  but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john f kennedy  that this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that  per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nations business  the most articulate republicans are those who  in their desire to get back at mr kennedy  already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed  and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care  if they also defeat the school bill  the gop task force wont have much research to do  it will early know why the party wont win back city votes  the  general assembly has important business to consider  the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner  after the griffinbyrd political troup has completed the circuit in november in the name of a prelegislative forum  this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history  every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances  not his convictions  hopedfor legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever  and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a selfinsurance system for the state in the midst of a governors race    how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt gov garland byrds senate committee on government operations   the situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governors race forward a few months  causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual  but when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november  the situation was aggravated  neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation  to have refused would have been political suicide  and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity  when the bravado comments are cast aside  the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates  it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the  serious candidates   but state party chairman james gray of albany said no  and he didnt mince any words   they are just asking too much   he said  we cant think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates  either  there are other dangers  politics is an accelerating game   if an opponent accuses you of lying  dont deny it  say he is a horse thief   runs an old adage  these men are spenders  if either one ever started making promises  there is no telling where the promises would end  griffins rural roads authority and byrds  miles of county contracts would look like paupers oaths  the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one  why not have them travel the state in november debating   it would present a forum for them in almost every community  but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governors race being run in the next legislature  the spectre of big spending programs  the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin  there is a way out of this  the chamber has not arranged a prelegislative forum  it has arranged a campaign for governor  if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring  and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates  it can provide a service to the state  but the legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race  former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was not a  great soldier   ikes somewhat like george washington  both won a pretty fairsized war with a modest assist from british strategy  congressmen returning from recess say the people admire president kennedy so much  theyre even willing to heed his call to sacrifice  and give up his program  slogan of the john birch society   paddle your own canoe  the guy who makes the motor boats may be a communist   a republican survey says kennedy won the  election on the religious issue  too many people were afraid if the gop won  theyd have to spend all their time praying  the providence journal editorial  jan   entitled  east greenwich faces a housing development problem  points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours  your suggested solution  it seems to me  is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward  and endorsement of  sound planning  first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested  this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town  the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come  this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither  to halt an influx of migrants  nor are we  setting up such standards for development that only the welltodo could afford to buy land and build in the new sites   what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development  it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs  bostitch  inc is approximately half way through a year exemption of their real estate tax  the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter  but this particular instance is  in my opinion  completely satisfactory  the  tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars  with our current  per hundred tax rate  it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should  try to develop a modest industrial plant  as the best way to meet these problems  in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure  as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow  mr richard preston  executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission  in his remarks to the governors conference on industrial development at providence on october     warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said   if this is the fundamental reason for a communitys interest or if this is the basic approach  success if any will be difficult to obtain   he went on to say   in the first place  industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities  it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be   while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer  the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth  we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities  one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools  and the other facing this prospect next year  it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase  if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning  what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage   where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials   i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life  the  fruitful course  of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called  for example    the east greenwich police department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department  thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the cowessetteast greenwichpotowomut area of the two communities    the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich    the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money  as do other kent county communities  for the support of the kent county memorial hospital  a regional facility    the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment    feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick  as reported in your newspapers  suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east greenwich    east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves    the education program for retarded children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community  i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich  i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts   and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised  these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when  where  and in what manner the community shall grow  we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions  until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts  i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny  i would like very much  on behalf of my husband and myself  to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund  it is indeed true  as stated in the famous novel of our day   for whom the bell tolls   that  no man is an island  entirely of itself   every man is a piece of the continent  a part of the main   thanks to the generosity of mr irving j fain  president of the temple beth el   rev dewitt clemens  pastor of the mathewson street methodist church   mr felix miranda  of the imperial knife co   and to mrs rozella switzer  regional director of the national conference of christians and jews  who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund  it is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man  and therefore  that most people are noble  helpful and good  bless you my friends  for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality  i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school  my future plans are to become a language teacher  of course  having this desire  i am very interested in education  a few weeks ago  i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston  the article also said that a person had to be  years old or over  and must not be going to high school to attend these classes  the following week  i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade  i wish you could see the situation as i see it  if russian pupils have to take these languages  how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language  but have to face so many exceptions   i do not think that america is like russia  not in the least   i am proud of my country  the small city i live in  my wonderful parents  my friends and my school   but i am also a young  able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough  then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students  well  there lies your answer  at the height of the first snowstorm we had  it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency  however  the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation  words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me  the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful  the rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather  had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did  perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time  many thanks for a job well done  the providence sunday journal article  jan   asking whether american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have nonserviceconnected disabilities sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news  usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page  on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of serviceconnected and nonserviceconnected disabled veterans  it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service  it can manifest itself before discharge from service  or it can come out years later  there is one other point we should never lose sight of  many veterans who enter va hospitals as nonservice cases later qualify as serviceconnected  no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years  the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the nonserviceconnected case  seem to be coldly impractical and outofstep with the wishes of the general public  i believe in priority for serviceconnected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals  but i dont believe we should close the door on nonserviceconnected patients  this matter is of great importance  and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death  or at least serious injuries  for many veterans  some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long  theres a reason for this length of stay  first of all  the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient  he has no experience with this veterans previous medical record  if the doctor is conscientious  he wants to study the patient  as a result  it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient  secondly  the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital  he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient  so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery  the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization  the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital  the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other  the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital  an adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any  state hospitals  it seems that open season upon veterans hospitalization is once more upon us  the american medical association is once again grinding out its tearsoaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer  do they  the ama  offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world   we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness  nevertheless  we wonder at the stand of the ama on the health problem confronting the aged  they opposed the forand bill  which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction   yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars  matched incidentally by a federal grant  to initiate   a lousy job  chicago  aug   no doubt there have been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house has had feelings of frustration  exasperation  exhaustion  and even panic  this we can sympathetically understand  but no president ever before referred to his as a  lousy job   as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen barry goldwater   during his aggressive campaign to win his present position  mr kennedy was vitriolic about this countrys  prestige  abroad  what does he think a remark like this  lousy  one does to our prestige and morale   if the president of the united states really feels he won himself a  lousy job   then heaven help us all  questions shelters evansville  ind  aug   defense secretary robert s mcnamara has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about  million dollars  why should congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection   top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time  the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground  sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least  miles in diameter  this sum spent for foreign economic aid  the peace corps  food for peace  or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace  increased world trade  and prosperity for every country on the globe  let us prepare for peace  instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization  short shorts on the campus chicago  aug   it seems college isnt what it should be  i refer to the attire worn by the students  upon a visit to a local junior college last week  i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing bermuda shorts  is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years   education should be uppermost in their minds  but with this attire how can anyone think it is so   it looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves  high school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students  many high school students go past my house every day  and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen  no matter how hot the day  they are dressed properly and not in shorts  masaryk award chicago  aug   the granting of the jan masaryk award august  to senator paul douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities  douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed masaryk  and against principles masaryk died to uphold  douglas has voted for aid to communists and for the destruction of individual freedom  public housing  foreign aid  etc   subsidies from cta oak park  aug   in todays  voice   the cta is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens  rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly  and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration  but why is it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people   why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should   the welfare of citizens  old and young  is the responsibility of the community  not only of that part of it that rides the aj  cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children  policemen  and firemen  marketing meat chicago  aug   in reply to a letter in todays  voice  urging the sale of meat after  pm  i wish to state the other side of the story  i am the wife of the owner of a small  independent meat market  my husbands hours away from home for the past years have been from  am to  pm the early part of the week  and as late as  or  on weekends  now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings  and sundays  too  for this is coming  there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source  freezing it  and shipping it to outlying stores  where meat cutters will not be required  if a customer wishes a special cut  it will not be available  we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged  whether we want it or not  most women  in this age of freezers  shop for the entire week on weekends  when prices are lower  also  many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them  independent market owners work six days a week   and my husband hasnt had a vacation in  years  no  we are not greedy  but if we closed the store for a vacation  we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block  the meat cutters union  which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area  represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets  what it is trying to do is to protect the little man  too  as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores  with choice of cut being made by the consumer  not the store  the legion convention and sidney holzman chicago  aug   i  too  congratulate the american legion  of which i am proud to have been a member for more than  years  on the recent state convention  i regret that bertha madeira  todays  voice   obtained incorrect information  had i been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege  the matter she raised would have been clarified  the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag  judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this  the resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag  it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and  without an amendment to the law  we could not enforce this  my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises  and not by innuendo criticize them  at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties  teaching the handicapped chicago  aug   the illinois commission for handicapped children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children  in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children  the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field  the illinois commission for handicapped children  which for  years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children  of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois  and of promoting more adequate services for them  indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children  from candlelight club minneapolis  aug   i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed your june  article on liberace  and to thank you for it  please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace  as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person  more school  less pay chicago  aug   is this  perhaps  one of the things that is wrong with our country   engineering graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the schools history   a month  my son  who has completed two years in engineering school  has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer  at a rate of  an hour he is now earning approximately  a month  ironic  is it not  that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer   the dupont case  editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page   washington  aug   your july  editorial regarding the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective tax relief for dupont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact  as a result  your criticism of attorney general robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate  unwarranted and unfair  the editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on dupont stockholders  in connection with the united states supreme court ruling that dupont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings  these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that dupont stockholders might have to pay  from an estimated  billion dollars under present law to as little as  million dollars  congressman wilbur d mills  chairman of the house ways and means committee  asked the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to antitrust law enforcement  the attorney general responded by letter dated july   copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public  in this letter  mr kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration  what effect the legislative proposals might have on future antitrust judgments  there are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the congress  not the department of justice  to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation  yet your editorial said   now the attorney general writes that no considerations  justify any loss of revenue of this proportion    what mr kennedy  in fact  wrote was   it is the departments view that no antitrust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion   the editorial  by omitting the words antitrust enforcement  totally distorted mr kennedys views  the headline is offensive  particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial  congresswoman church wilmette  aug   i concur most heartily with todays letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen and sen douglas  but when you write to congresswoman church  bless her heart  your letter is answered fully and completely  should she disagree  she explains why in detail  when she agrees  you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged  i think we have the hardest working  best representative in congress  harmful drinks downers grove  aug   a recent news story reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed  airplane passengers  minutes in london while they finished their drinks  they do

martin to guzzle  toward socialism providence  aug   overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nations main industries  in covert socialism  toward which america is moving  private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them  in order to attract new industries   states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise  this is a step toward overt socialism  issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions   workers of the party  to the editor  sir  we are writing in reference to a recent  suggestion  made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city  registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences   the day before election day  to which we are entitled as a legal holiday  we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as  workers of the party   being ethical and professional people interested in community health and wellbeing  we felt this wasnt a function of our position  such tactics reek of totalitarianism   as we understand  this directive was given to all city and county employes  to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation  we  therefore  considered the  suggestion  an insult to our intelligence  ethics  bill of rights  etc  our only obligation for this day is to vote  free of persuasion  for the person we feel is capable in directing the public  this is our duty  not as nurses or city employes  but as citizens of the united states   plusone  shelters to the editor  sir  i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters  does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves  but ready to demand that  the community  help and protect them   community shelters are  of course  necessary for those having no space for shelter  if in a town of  private homes  half of them have shelters  the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent  in designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that homes occupants   plusone   so he will be able to take in a stranger  i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart  will get busy and be the first member of our

nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity  it is high time the united states began to realize that the godgiven rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga  in the united nations charter  the right of selfdetermination is also an essential principle  this  again  applies to katanga  the people of katanga had fought for  and obtained  their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga  and his cohorts  by political  economic  geographic and natural standards  they were justified in doing so  the united states and the un denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of selfdetermination of the katangans  county college costs to the editor  sir  permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to  the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny  the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers  under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed   none will be elected  the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate  this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college  and the director and two members of the board of freeholders  it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders  which  shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed  levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes   the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college  since two of these could be trustees of the college  actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue  this is taxation without representation  taxing improvements to the editor  sir  your editorial   housing speedup   is certainly not the answer to our slum problems  the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions  change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties  then see what a boom in all trades  as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers  will happen  our entire economy will have a terrific uplift   natural causes  to the editor  sir  an old man is kicked to death by muggers  the medical examiner states that death was due to  natural causes   i once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york  it is listed as  death due to natural causes   praises exhibit to the editor  sir  every resident of this city should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit  our changing skyline in newark   it will be at the museum until march   it is a revelation of what has been done  what is being done and what will be done in newark as shown by architects plans  models and pictures  it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud of this city  it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic  school and religious life of the community so that that phase of newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit  parkway courtesy to the editor  sir  i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway  recently i traveled the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere  one even gave my little dog a biscuit  it was very refreshing   deep peep show  the viewers of the  deep peep show  at th and m streets nw have an added attraction  the view of a fossilized cypress swamp  twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site  a black coallike deposit has been encountered  this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypresslike trees were growing  the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay  some of the stumps are as much as three feet long  but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments  although the wood has been changed to coal  much of it still retains its original cell structure  in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time  these microfossils indicate the swamp was  formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing  the th street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on th street reported in the washington post  august     which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger  working for peace recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air  while i respect his sincere concern for peace  he made four points that i would like to question    he said   lets work for peace instead of protection from aggression   i would ask   why not do both    military power does not cause war   war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people  are we not late  especially those of us who call ourselves friends  in doing enough about this lack of understanding     as to protection  the speaker disapproved of shelters  pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone  is this a reason for saving no one   would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone     the speaker suggested that the desolation of a postattack world would be too awful to face  if the world comes to this  wouldnt it be the very time when courage and american knowhow would be needed to help survivors rebuild   many of our young people think it would    lastly  the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it  civilian defense   in   public law  created civil defense  different from civiliangroups of world war    a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster  natural or manmade  far from creating fear  as the speaker suggests  preparedness  knowing what to do in an emergency  gives people confidence  civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve  but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing  but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster  storm  flood  accident or even war   pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs  i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someones apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide  in addition  would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash   i grant that the dog may not be really protective  based on his training  but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest  how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog   i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments  sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe   could senator humphrey be serious in his proposal   is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists comfort   perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended  the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak  why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat   unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season  as an added suggestion to balance the budget  the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument  it is visible throughout the city  and men from madison ave would jump at the chance  sen hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart  he  like most of us  wants to be able to sit  to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors  let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens  let us  like the french  have outdoor cafes where we may relax  converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd  dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee  may   by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work  for a neutral germany soviets said to fear resurgence of german militarism to the editor of the new york times  for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large  powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity  the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations  recent statements by wellknown scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fallouts should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations  president kennedy was right when he said   we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate   i have just returned from a sevenweek trip to europe and the far east  it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war  the fact is that the italians  french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs  we have no right to criticize them  as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war  we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin  it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us  but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany  soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation  in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated  probable agreement the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism  berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse  actually  the communists  out of fear of a united and armed germany  would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the un  if the communists are sincere in wanting a united  neutral and disarmed germany  it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age  it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation  france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany  if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria  president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called  operation survival  which has many facets  why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states   a united germany  freed of militarism  might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world  meeting un obligations to the editor of the new york times  in your editorial of sept   the smoldering congo  you make the following comment   far too many states are following the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments  it is up to the assembly to take action against them  they are violating their charter obligation  the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion   i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations   article   section    the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization   section    the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly   article    a member of the united nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years   the ussr and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget  but they refuse  as do the arab states  to support the united nations expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel  and the un troops in the congo  which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations  but by a special budget  according to the official interpretation of the charter  a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the  special  united nations budgets  and of course cannot be expelled from the organization  which you suggested in your editorial   due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for expulsion  to aid international law connally amendments repeal held step toward world order to the editor of the new york times  in your sept  editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eightyseventh congress you referred to the lack of  consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril   yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this countrys domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international court of justice  the connally amendment says that the united states  rather than the court  shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party  if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic  the court has no jurisdiction  since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states  it also prevents us from using the court effectively  yet although the kennedy administration  and the eisenhower administration before it  have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment  as contrary to our best interests  no action has yet been taken  our  destiny  in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace  with justice  under law  to achieve this destiny  acts as well as words are needed  not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect  what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment  an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our selfjudging attitude toward the court  enable us to utilize it  and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order   we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eightyseventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment  for better subway services to the editor of the new york times  many homebound subway riders utilizing the flushingmain street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their express comes to a stop  leaving them stranded and strained  to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventyfourth street and change for the ind  this takes a daily toll of time and temper  the transit authority has recently placed in operation  hold  lights at bmt thirtyninth and fiftyninth street stations in brooklyn  this  holds  the local until the express passengers change trains  without question  this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the woodside station  phone service criticized to the editor of the new york times  as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly  from three to four hours a day  in the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service  it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing  however  there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators  i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing persontoperson calls  special longdistance calls  etc  either it is lack of training  lack of proper screening when hiring  lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company  which does have a governmentblessed monopoly  fairpriced funeral to the editor  i disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be governmentcontrolled  the funeral for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price  far less than i had expected to pay  but the hospitals and doctors should be  helping retarded children to the editor  recently i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children  hazel park donates its recreation center  five days a week  to the school  there is no charge and no state aid  kiwanis  american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support  there are  children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school  reading  writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass  they make beautiful objects  enough trading stamps were collected to buy a passenger station wagon  southfield schools furnish an old passenger bus  the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat   the school is located at  mile road  woodward heights  visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do  jobs for cavanagh to the editor  i was surprised at mayor mirianis defeat  but perhaps mayorelect cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago  maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare  dpw and sanitation  negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great  he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night  there should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling  our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case  drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out  educate the city employes to give real service to the public  after all  they are paid by the public  they should be examples  church finds news features are helpful to the editor  at a recent meeting of the womens association of the trumbull ave united presbyterian church  considerable use was made of material from the detroit news on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english bible  some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration  the daily prayer and three minutes a day  as being very helpful  we feel that the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines  rude youngsters to the editor  thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence  how old do you have to be to remember when americans  especially children  were encouraged to be polite   why has this form of gentility gone out of american life   how can we oldfashioned parents  who still feel that adults are due some respect from children  battle the new type of advertising that appears on tv without denying the children the use of television entirely   writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of  modern  parents they have observed  from necessity  they are also inspired by the  hardsell  attitude of the sponsor  so  finally  it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising  dunes park advocate to the editor  i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area  ghost town   to the editor of the inquirer  i just wish to congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles  we have now a quiet city  fewer automobiles  less congestion  and fewer retail customers shopping in center city  good for mr trimmer  maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a  ghost  town  defends big trucks to the editor of the inquirer  i worked on the schuylkill expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldnt be an expressway  without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future  mr george hough  oct   sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop  the trucks today help pay for this highway  they try to keep within the speed limits  although todays trucks are as fast as passenger cars  a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road  out of school at  to the editor of the inquirer  the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at  should have signed his letter  simpleton  instead of  simplicitude   such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden  there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates  but not for the dropouts  what we need is more vocational training in high schools  not more dropouts  two wrongs to the editor of the inquirer  i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right   i am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is  will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children   if an atom bomb in  could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it  as i see it  if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back  the nuclear weapons we now have  at least the bombs  can inflict all the demage that is necessary  why do we need bigger and better bombs   i repeat  two wrongs do not make a right   we tremble not  to the editor of the inquirer  everyone should take time to read martin luthers hymn  a mighty fortress is our god   especially the first half of the third verse  out of the race to the editor of the inquirer  to our everlasting shame  we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki  having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race  are we to be the master of the atom  or will the atom be our master  and destroy us   why trust jagan   to the editor of the inquirer  just because cheddi jagan  new boss of british guiana  was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isnt a red  we have quite a few homegrown specimens of our own  if we go all gooey over this newest castro  until he proves he isnt  weve got rocks in our heads  how many times must we get burned before we learn   russia and un to the editor of the inquirer  just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one  the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides  intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan  london or pearl harbor  that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war  russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world  why arent the soviets expelled from the un   belated tribute to the editor of the inquirer  while  better late than never  may have certain merits  the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation  had it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations was living  unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and  in many ways  thankless task  according to one report  however  mr hammarskjold was considered  too controversial  a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring  actually  of course  that label  controversial  applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet union  at khrushchevs door  therefore  can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated  it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed  as has happened so often in the past  the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy   people to people  to the editor of the inquirer  just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for providing a firstclass example of  people to people  good will  if only this could be done more often  with such heartening results  many of the earths  big problems  would shrink to the insignificances they really are  ps  thanks for your good coverage of ahmads visit  too   expressway answer  east river drive to the editor of the inquirer  your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable   however  several pertinent considerations deserve recognition  one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea  we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice  they start on the east side of the schuylkill  have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination  bridges  tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings  each one of these is  by its nature  a focal point or a point of natural congestion  we should avoid these congestion points or  putting it another way  keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river  on the east side  this can be accomplished by several logical steps     widen the east river drive at least one lane     so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems     paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges  one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent     this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive  shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer  i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square    take away george washingtons statue    replace it with the statue of one or another of the worlds famous dictators  theres no sense in being reminded of times that were  washington square seems not part of a free land  it may remind one of russia  china or east berlin   but it cant remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for  the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals  because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square  the matter may seem a small thing to some people  i know  but its a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission has posted signs in washington square saying  the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square  fairmount park commission does each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance   if birds dont belong in a square or park  what does   they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature  the trees are their homes   but the commission does not share such sentiments  the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds  starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon  from city hall  just a preliminary measure  if any are left  presently  we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too  the city government is not united in an allout  tothedeath drive to stamp out gangs  delinquents  thugs  murderers  rapists  subversives  indeed no  let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe  lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive  of course  in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because were afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say   how come   whats your motive   who wants this deed done     in this small way do the leaders of a city  or of a nation  inure the masses to watching  or even inflicting  torture and death  upon even their fellow men  one means to help the birds occurs to me  let the chimes that ring over washington square twice daily  discontinue any piece of music but one  let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began  the hymn  abide with me   we will know  and he will know  to whom it is rendered  what the birds would ask  not pushups but standups to the editor of the inquirer  there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans are too  soft   unfortunately  those who would remedy our  softness  seek to do so with calisthenics  they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy  it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft  ashamed of our wealth and power  afraid of socalled world opinion and addicted to peace  we have allowed our softheartedness to lead to softheaded policies  when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right  when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit selfdetermination  when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation  when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war  and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom  then  and only then will we no longer be  soft   america doesnt need to  pushup   she needs to stand up   disputes stans column business scandal views to the editor  the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals  is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit  however  he states unequivocally  the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor   i must  in fairness  take issue with his premise  primarily because the socalled scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals  the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan hearings had to do with  sweetheart contracts   these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes  a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute  anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders  further  it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrumgriffin act  escalation unto death the nuclear war is already being fought  except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets  not yet  it is being fought  moreover  in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories  they predicted escalation  and escalation is what we are getting  the biggest nuclear device the united states has exploded measured some  megatons  although our bs are said to be carrying two megaton bombs apiece  some time ago  however  mr khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made  the soviet union would make them  he seems to have at least a few  and megaton bombs on hand  since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock  and now  of course  the hue and cry for counterescalation is being raised on our side  khrushchev threatens us with a megaton bomb   so be it  then we must embark on a crash program for megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety  and neutron bombs  which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing  so escalation proceeds  ad infinitum or  more accurately  until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds  what is needed  philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun  october   is a discontinuity  the escalation must end sometime  and probably quite soon   only a discontinuity can end it   professor morrison writes   the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction  or that of diplomatic policy   morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red china  it is the most vulnerable of the great powers  europe of course must be written off out of hand  he feels  therefore  that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take  his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon  governor rockefeller  past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission  dr edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war  these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing  in the atmosphere  on the greatest possible scale  all in the name of national security  escalation is their first love and their last   they will be faithful unto death  capable as their minds may be in some directions  these guardians of the nations security are incapable of learning  or even of observing  if this capacity had not failed them  they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation  he has gained only one thing  he has exploded a megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges  but if his purpose was to inspire terror  his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously  not terror  but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere  khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused  yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps  when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another  it is only natural  thus  when the russians sent up their first sputnik  american chagrin was human enough  and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable  but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly  the tide turns when east germans fled to the west by the thousands  paeans of joy rose from the throats of western publicists  they are less vocal now  when it is the west berliners who are migrating  the flood is not as great  only  a week according to one apparently conservative account  but it is symptomatic  west berlin morale is low and  in age distribution  the situation is unfavorable  nearly  per cent of west berlins  residents are sixtyfive or older  only  per cent are under fifteen  r h s crossman  mp  writing in the manchester guardian  states that departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of   but of  a week  and applications to leave have risen to  a week  the official statistics show that  per cent are employed workers or independent professional people  whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead  the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by  arrivals each week from west germany  but the hard truth  says crossman  is that  the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german  as distinct from russian  troops was a major communist victory  which dealt west berlin a deadly  possibly a fatal  blow  the gallant halfcity is dying on its feet   another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer  london   mark arnoldfoster writes   people are leaving  west berlin  because they think it is dying  they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months frontline work in factories in west berlin  berlins resilience is amazing  but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed   the handwriting is on the wall  the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city  state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary  and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort  will not avail  tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful  the materials for compromise are at hand  the nation  walter lippmann and other sober commentators  see alan clark on p   have spelled them out again and again  a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph  but it will save berlin  or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence  if that is what the west wants  vacancy the removal of stalins body from the mausoleum he shared with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history  it is  in fact  a relatively mild chastisement of the dead  a british writer  richard haestier  in a book  dead men tell tales  recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry    who had died nearly  years earlier  was torn to pieces by a mob  and in england  after the restoration  the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at tyburn  the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster  and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows  contemplating these posthumous punishments  stalin should not lose all hope  in   parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster  facing whitehall and there  presumably  he still stands  nikita khrushchev  however  has created yet another problem for himself  the lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy  moscow is a crowded city  and the creed of communism deplores waste  who will take stalins place beside lenin   there is karl marx  of course  buried in london  the macmillan government might be willing to let him go  but he has been dead seventyeight years and even the soviet morticians could not make him look presentable  who  then  is of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin   who but nikita himself   since he has just shown who is top dog  he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people  besides  he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which  what with exhumations and rehabilitations  seems to match that of life  suppose he did lie beside lenin  would it be permanent   if some future khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor  would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession   when a man is laid to rest  he is entitled to stay put  if nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery  everyone will understand  u thant of burma the appointment of u thant of burma as the uns acting secretary general  at this writing  the choice appears to be certain  offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends  mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland were early favorites in the running  but france didnt like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter  with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr hammarskjold  u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto  what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy  in all the bitter infighting  the squabbles over election procedures  the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant secretaries theme  the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat  he has  moreover  another qualification which augurs well for the future  he is a buddhist  which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma  but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung  u thant of course  will hold office until the spring of   when mr hammarskjolds term would have come to an end  whether the compromises  on both sides  that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen  mr khrushchevs demand for a troika is dormant  not dead   the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that u thant represents  in a sense  the showdown promised by mr hammarskjolds sudden and tragic death has been avoided   no precedents have been set as yet   structurally  the un is still fluid  vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it  but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong  to the hills  girls  no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade  these are mentalities which crave action  and they are beginning to get it  as messrs salsich and engh report on page   even in areas where political connotations are  deliberately    left vague  the spirit of vigilantism is spreading  friends  a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers  describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at foley  alabama   if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast   the account reads   they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commandotrained telephone employees  all girls  heavily armed and mobilized as a fastmoving civil defense outfit   operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minutes notice   according to friends  the unit was organized by john snook  a former world war   commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company  the girls  very fetching in their uniforms  are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck   they are also trained with carbines  automatic weapons  pistols  rifles and other such ladies accessories  this may be opera bouffe now  but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy  the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means  the doctrine has never worked   it is not working now  the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms   it cannot bring them into actual play  a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined  as the civic temper rises  the more naive citizens begin to play soldier  but the guns are real  soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst  all false gods resemble moloch  at least in the early phases of their careers  so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idolworship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice  but there is reason in all things  and in this country the heathenish cult of the motorcar is exceeding all bounds in its demands  the annual butchery of  american men  women and children to satiate its bloodlust is excessive   a quota of  a year would be more than sufficient  no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace  if the railroads  for example  regularly slaughtered  passengers each year  the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety  for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states  but by comparison with the railroad  the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship  so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily  yet it is plainly time to make a start  and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic  without being fanatical  here  then  is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning  from next new years day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways  publicizing it on all media of communication  to avoid suspicion of bigotry  let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meatwagon has picked up the twentyfive thousandth corpse   but let the twentyfive thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the  state highway commissioners  then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july     the scene  of course  should be nine miles northwest of centralia  illinois  the geographical center of population according to the census  a special grandstand  protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois  should be erected for occupancy by honored guests  who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized  the band should play the rogues march as a processional  switching to  hail columbia  happy land    as the trap is sprung  independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights  the first of which is life  and when any government becomes subversive of that end  it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it  the highway system is an agency of government  and when it grinds up  americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers  which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do  hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government  but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens  which would certainly alter it  and definitely for the better  moreover  the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political  but at least partially  and perhaps primarily social  it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices  for instance  the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon  not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis  or  as it is generally termed  staying put  true  the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor  even a miniscule sect  and their credo   homekeeping hearts are happiest   is as disreputable as socinianism  nonetheless  although few in number they are a stubborn crew  as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists  which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith  perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia  robert ruarks grandfather  who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is  all this gallivantin   in any event  the yearly sacrifice of  victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith  somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason  since appeals to morality  to humanity  and to sanity have had such small effect  perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example  if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive  say beyond  per annum  then somebody is going to hang  it follows that the more eminent the victim  the more impressive the lesson  to hang  governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways   so  all things considered  the highway commissioners would seem to be elected  as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth  the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race  but the guilt is shared by the united states  britain and france  the other members of the atomic club  until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september   the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians  and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down  as it descends  the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body   for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies  the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years  and on to succeeding generations  so  while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning  history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat  shock  dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions   a holierthanthou sermon was not  on october   after the soviets had detonated at least  nuclear devices  ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country  in  self protection   might have to resume aboveground tests  more recently  the chairman of the atomic energy commission  dr glenn t seaborg   admitted  to a news conference in las vegas  nevada  that the us might fall behind russia  he apparently meant in weapons development  if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain  the trial balloons are afloat  all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood  but for the average citizen  unfortunately  this is one of sciences worstmarked channels  full of tricky currents and unknown depths  the scientists  in and out of government  do not agree on some of the most vital points  at least publicly  on the one hand  the public health service declared as recently as october  that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots  do not warrant undue public concern  or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj  but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles  will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations  and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states   then it added   it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be  nor how many people will be affected   having hedged its bets in this way  phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all   at present radiation levels  and even at somewhat higher levels  the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected   then  to conclude on an indeterminate note   nevertheless  if fallout increased substantially  or remained high for a long time  it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world   dr linus pauling  a nobel prize winner in chemistry  has been less ambiguous  whether you choose to agree with him or not  after declaring  in an article last month in frontier magazine  that the russian testing  carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world   he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled  megatons  the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations  children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects  longlived carbon from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic  neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next  generations  and between  and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiationproduced diseases such as leukemia  most of these would be in the northern hemisphere  where the fallout is concentrating  paulings estimate of  megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high  but a total of  megatons is a distinct possibility  the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups  from which agreedon generalizations could be drawn  but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem  its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing  an illustration of this attitude is found in john a mccones letter to dr thomas lauritsen  reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic  to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout  a recent study on radiation exposure by the aecs division of biology and medicine stated   the question of the biological effect of  radiation  doses is not considered  herein  of course  the aec is in a bind now  if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout  it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests  so the commissions announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences  with the fission yield usually left vague  now  of course  that the russians are the nuclear villains  radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid  when the us was testing in the atmosphere  the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout  if not exactly good for you  might not be much worse than a bad cold  after a nuclear blast  one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days  about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof  things arent that simple anymore  yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout  it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count  how much fallout will we get   as of october   the aec had reported  shots in the new soviet series   of them in a megaton range  including a super bomb with a yield of  to  megatons  the equivalent of  million to  million tons of tnt    and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported  assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at  megatons  a conservative computation is that the  announced tests produced a total yield of at least  megatons  some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to  megatons  and that the full megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated  if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests  the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion  meaning a fission yield of  to  megatons thus far  to this must be added the  to  megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in  and the informal threepower test moratorium that began in november    resuming atmospheric tests one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas  the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself  that dilemma is as much with us as ever  the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing  a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests  when this second dilemma first became obvious  during the mid to late s  the united states appeared to have three choices  it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations  it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination  or it could have chosen to find  by negotiation  some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security  this third choice was in fact made  with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks  however  the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken  once again  the united states must choose  and once again  the choices are much the same  only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder  the first choice  abandoning tests entirely  would not only be unpopular domestically  but would surely be exploited by the russians  the second choice  full testing  has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere  the third choice  negotiation  presupposes  as russian behavior demonstrates  a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable  we take the position  however  that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us  it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable  its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice   one which  should it fail  will not have contaminated the conscience  that is the contamination we most fear  leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral  the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice  for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing  in particular  governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests  speaking recently in miami  governor rockefeller said that  to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests  we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests   taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion  he argued that the responsibility of the united states is  to do  confidently and firmly  not what is popular  but what is right   what was missing in the governors argument  as in so many similar arguments  was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right  the possibility  as he asserted  that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise  unless  of course  we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand  besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governors case  one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary  recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have  to the contrary  assured us that our lead is very great  unless the administration and the defense department have been deceiving us  the facts do not support the assertion that we are  compelled  to resume atmospheric testing  it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may  at some point in the future  be necessary and even justifiable  but a resumption does not seem justifiable now  what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations  we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake  this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism  too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part  there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does  the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start  ecumenical hopes when his holiness pope john   first called for an ecumenical council  and at the same time voiced his yearning for christian unity  the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate  with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom  but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known  there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides  the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church  as it has turned out  however  the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses  two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective  each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy  first of all  it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity  far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task  the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light  equally significant  pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity  a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity  secondly  a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church  the establishment  by the holy father  of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in  was the most dramatic mark of this concern  the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches assembly in new delhi as  official  observers reverses the churchs earlier stand  the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state  cardinal cicognani  for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act  nor can one forget pope johns unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury  augustin cardinal bea  the director of the secretariate for christian unity  has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the churchs stance toward the protestant and orthodox churches  noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion  he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone  for discouragement  or the temptation to abandon our efforts   would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of god  the irresistible efficacy of prayer  the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit   can any christian fail to respond to these words   the budget deficit the administrations official budget review  which estimates a  billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year  isnt making anyone happy  certainly it isnt making the president happy  and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition  how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year  we sympathize with mr kennedy  but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesnt please us either  although for very different reasons  furthermore  we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring  in the first place  a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhowers estimate of a  billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing presidents farewell gift of a political boobytrap to his successor  the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received  the rest of the deficit is also easily understood  four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense  an expenditure necessitated by the pennywise policies of the eisenhhower administration  quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere  four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program  a responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower  the farm program will cost an additional  billion  because of unusual weather factors  the food for peace program and other new measures  antirecession programs  aid for the unemployed  their children and for depressed areas  account for only  million of the  billion dollar deficit  our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small  most seriously in regard to the conventional arms buildup and in aid and welfare measures  and yet mr kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of  tightening up  and  economizing   we wish the president would remember that  fiscal responsibility  was the battlecry of the party that lost the election  the party that won used to say something about a new frontier  ethics and peace introduction of the  dialogue  principle proved strikingly effective at the thirtyfourth annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october  two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants  and when the speaker was a catholic  one  discussant  on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion  several effects were immediately evident  sessions devoted to  ethics and foreign policy trends    moral principle and political judgment    christian ethics in the cold war  and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves  usually questions from the floor were directed to the noncatholic speaker or discussion leader  in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law  which dr william v obrien of georgetown university  advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy  that aristoteleanthomistic principle experienced a thorough goingover from a number of the participants  but in the end the concept came to reassert itself  speakers declared that protestants often make use of it  if  perhaps  by some other name  a lebanese moslem told about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the  divine law   while a caip member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new un nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent  the impression was unmistakable that  whatever one may choose to call it  natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence  another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself  the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable  it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each others positions and better comprehension of ones own  but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed  and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues  one effect of the spirited giveandtake of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts  knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest  tactical  atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use  to defend berlin  for example   the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account   it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative  everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question  i was searching for an accent of selfdelusion or  even  of hypocrisy  i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke  though granted they were  almost all  members of the official family who  presumably  harbor official thoughts  but i questioned  also  professional soldiers  who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarians dreamy irredentism  their answer was  it can be done  and we will do it  and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang kaishek   in america   i said   practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to reenter the mainland  what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that  and that it can be done    he smiled   he always smiles  at least at visitors  i gather  he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me  who asked the most asinine questions  i recalled sympathetically the dukes complaint in brownings  my last duchess    he smiled  and said a word or two to the interpreter  who turned to me   the president wonders where you are going after you leave taipei    that  i smarted  is a royal rebuff if ever there was one  i answered the routine question about my itinerary  rather coolly  chiang spoke again  this time at greater length   the president says   the translator came in   that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia  and that everywhere you went  you would seek the answer to your question  he says that if he were to express to you  once again  his own profound determination to go to the mainland  and his faith that that return is feasible  he would merely sound redundant  so you yourself must seek these objective data  and come to your own conclusions  any information we have here in taiwan is at your disposal   fair enough  what are the relevant data   for every person on taiwan  there are sixty in mainland china  if the raw population figures are crucially relevant  then it is idle to think of liberation  as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia  relative military manpower   less than   but at least   the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army  say four million  the armed forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about   though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated  skill   training   morale   it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia  and the army the best trained  the morale is very high  even so  it adds up to impossible odds  except that the question arises  on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight   the miserable people of china  the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play  cannot themselves resist overtly  they think  perforce  of physical survival  everything else is secondary  but the army which mao continues to feed well  where are its sympathies   the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family  cultivated in china over thousands of years  it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization  every soldier in the army has  somewhere  relatives who are close to starvation  the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion  it is assumed  but will their discontent spread to the officer class   the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed  a despot does not economize on his generals  but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews  their privations are almost beyond endurance  in behalf of what   leninismmarxism  as understood by exegete mao  to whom will the generals stay loyal   there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot  they would vote for food for their family  in place of ideological purity out on the farm  it is another question whether  they   or a single general  off in a corner of china  secure for a few  galvanizing    days at least from instant retaliation  will defy the party  but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there  but there must be a catalytic pressure  the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes  which  together  may prove fatal  the first was the commune program  which will ensure agricultural poverty for years  the family is largely broken up   and where it is not  it is left with no residue  and the social meaning of this is enormous  for it is the family that  in china  has always provided social security for the indigent  the sick  the downandout members of the clan  now the government must do that   but the government is left with no reserve granary  under the agricultural system it has ordained  thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged  and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security  the second mistake is tibet  tibet has historically served china as a buffer state  a friendly state  sometimes only semiindependent  but never hostile  china never tried to integrate tibet by extirpating the peoples religion and institutions  red china is trying to do this  and she is not likely ever to succeed  tibet is too vast  the terrain is too difficult  tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france  these continuing pressures  social  economic and military  are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension  the imposition of yet another pressure  a strong one  from the outside  might cause it to snap  the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men  they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control  first and foremost  they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime  on these they feel they can rely  secondly  they depend on americas  moral cooperation  when the crucial moment arrives  they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest  we will receive the opportunity gladly  i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day  he affected  most properly  not to understand my point  but he  and all of china  wears the scars of american indecisiveness  and he knows what an uncertain ally we are  we have been grand to formosa itself  lots of aid  and  most of the time  a policy of support for the offshore islands  but our outlook has been  and continues to be  defensive  a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr kennedys views on the world struggle  the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux  and are poised to strike  there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation  the moment of truth is the moment of crisis  during the slow buildup  the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details  fine words  strutting gestures  the crisis burns these suddenly away  there the truth is  open to eyes that are willing to look  the moment passes  new selfdeceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the toonaked bones  a truthrevealing crisis erupted in katanga for a couple of days this month  to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies  before memory  too  clouds over  let us make a note or two of what could be seen  the measure was instantly taken  as always in such cases  of public men at many levels  one knows better  now  who has bone and who has jelly in his spine  but i am here concerned more with policy than with men  public men come and go but great issues of policy remain  now  everyone knows  or knew in the week of december   that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy  the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful  orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most prowestern and anticommunist within any of the new nations  the only place in africa  moreover  where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved  of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations  but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was in reality the principal  the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies  to the entire western community  by our policy the west was  is  split  but the key revelation is not new  the controlling pattern was first displayed in the hungarysuez crisis of november   it reappears  in whole or part  whenever a new crisis exposes the reality  in cuba last spring  with which the dominican events of last month should be paired    at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles   in relation to laos  algeria  south africa   right now  with almost cartoon emphasis  in the temporally linked complex of tshombegizengagoaghana  what the moments reveal this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows  under prevailing policy  the us can take the initiative against the right  but cannot take the initiative against the left  it makes no difference what part of the world is involved  what form of regime  what particular issue  the us cannot take the initiative against the left  there is even some question whether the us can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left  we can attack tshombe  but not gigenza  no matter that gizenga is moscows man in the congo  no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men  no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa   even granted that the congo should be unified  you dont protect western security by first removing the prowestern weight from the power equilibrium   we can force britain and france out of the suez  but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest  we can mass our fleet against the trujillos  but not against the castros  we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola  but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall  much less  give the simple order to push the wall down  we officially receive the antifrench  moscowallied algerian fln  but we denounce the proeurope  anticommunist oas as criminal  in the very week of our war against katanga  we make a  million grant to kwame nkrumah  who has just declared his solidarity with the communist bloc  and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship  as our planes land the war materiel that kills prowestern katangans  we stand supinely bleating while nehrus troops smash into a fivehundredyearold district of our nato ally  portugal  what explains this unidirectional paralysis   it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international  and in some degree our domestic  policy  the suezhungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration  but only made more consistent and more active  key to the puzzles most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa  katanga and ghana  as to the suezhungary crisis before them  is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia  africa and latin america  from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the  uncommitted    neutralist    contested   nations  especially on those whose leaders make the most noise  nehru  tito  nkrumah  sukarno  betancourt  etc  our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes  if we grasp this orientation as a key  our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible  and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left  broadway the unoriginals to write a play  the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination  the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it  nowadays  more and more  all he needs is someone elses book  to get started  he does not scan the world about him   he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists  so far this season  broadways premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays  best from abroad  of straight dramas  there are all the way home  which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel  a death in the family   the wall  awkwardly based on the john hersey novel   advise and consent  lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller   face of a hero  closed   based on a pierre boulle novel  the only original works attempting to reach any stature  tennessee williams disappointing domestic comedy  period of adjustment  and arthur laurents clever but empty invitation to a march  clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals  a taste of honey  by britains young   when she wrote it  shelagh delaney   becket  by frances jean anouilh   the hostage  closed   by irelands brendan behan  among the musicals  camelot came from t h whites the once and future king  and novels were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do re mi  wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals  but pretty bad  leaving top honors again to an import  the jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce  the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces  send me no flowers  closed   under the yumyum tree  critics choice  in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival  broadway is not even adapting books  but reconverting old movies  hail the conquering hero and lili   dry of life  originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad  some memorable plays have been drawn from books  notably life with father and diary of anne frank  and particularly in the musical field  adaptations have long been the rule  from die fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma and my fair lady  as critic walter kerr points out   adaptations  so long as they are good  still qualify as creative   and other defenders invariably argue that  after all  shakespeare and moliere were adapters too  the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world   most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book  squeeze it dry of life  and add only one contribution of their own  stage technique  the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense  producers cannot afford to take chances  but that explanation is only partly true  offbroadway  where production is still comparatively cheap  is proving itself only slightly more original  laudably enough  it is offering classics and offbeat imports  but last week only one us original was on the boards  robert d hocks stunning civil war work  borak  the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of us playwrights  nightclubs the cooch terpers he   come with me to the casbah   she   by subway or cab    that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan  as more and more new yorkers were discovering th street and eighth avenue  where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian nights  grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american inpost of belly dancing  several more will open soon  their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the nd street burlesque joints  but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial  neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis  the belly boites  with their papiermache palm trees or handpainted ionic columns  heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families  customers often bring their children   between performances  enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces  except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor  the people watch in calm absorption  small  shirtsleeved orchestras play in  or  time  using guitars  violins  and more alien instruments with names that would open sesame  the oud  grandfather of the lute   the darbuka  a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass   the def  a lowpitched tambourine  the girls sit quietly with the musicians  wearing prim dresses or plain  secretarial shifts  until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem  continuum of mankind  if a dancer is good  she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny  the continuum of mankind  but a great many of what variety calls the  cooch terpers  are considerably less cosmic than that  each dancer follows the ancient oriental pattern  she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates  and  through breathing and muscle control  she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room  this is done at varying speeds  ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli  a musical term meaning double strings  to the fastest  ecstatic karshilama  meaning greetings or welcome   the new york dancers are highly eclectic  varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations  back bends or floor crawls  but they do not strip  the striptease is crass   the belly dance leaves more to the imagination  when a dancer does well  she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills  although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers costumes  with tips  the girls average between  and  a week  depending on basic salary  although they are forbidden to sit with the customers  the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks  and most of them can bolt one down in midshimmy  the melting pot  all over the country  belly clubs have never been bigger  especially in detroit  boston and chicago  and even in small towns   one of the best dancers  a turkish girl named semra  works at a roadhouse outside bristol  conn  the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents  notably voluble  blackbearded murat somay  a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central abdomen  he can offer nine turkish girls  plans to import at least  more  but a great many of the dancers are more or less native  sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis  conducted by lebanese and syrians in the us  where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs  as the g
